several things going on here The sleep should be addressed with a primary care
physician to rule out any physical issues Sleep is the big reset and allows us
to function in the day What happens during a depression is that our thoughts
race and it is as though our brain wont shut off Medication can help with
thisI also use a Pranayama yoga breathing technique called the four
fold breath which has great usefulness for relaxing us and often does work quite well with allowing
us to sleep You can read about it here httpsbillleavitttherapycombreathingtechniquesthefourfoldbreathYour
thoughts on feeling worthless to everyone fall under a heading of thinking
error in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy CBT known as overgeneralization In CBT
thoughts lead to emotions so we are going to pick the statement apart and then
reframe it First list
the evidence that contradicts the thought Has anyone in the past made positive
comments toward you This might be hard to recall if we are in a rut but at
some point in life we frequently have had some positives expressed towards us
by others Everyone is an absolute The
specifics on why you are thinking this need to be addressed How are you
arriving at this conclusion There may be specific people that we want more
validation from Or specific people might have made offhand hurtful comments such
as a family member teacher or coworker but if I extrapolate that to a global
and think that everyone thinks I am worthless that thought is not rooted in
facts 
What are
the Pros and Cons of thinking this way What are the Benefits and Costs There
are very little pros or benefits to thinking this way Its just going to
continue to tear you down and make you feel bad So can we reframe the thought
about the situation Is there another way of looking at the situation Again
we need the specifics on how you are arriving at this conclusion and a one on
one therapist can definitely help you with this but the thinking that you are
using to arrive at the conclusion needs to be recast into a more helpful
mindset"	0	115	train

from a condition known as Seasonal Affective Disorder SAD Whether you have
been diagnosed with SAD or are finding yourself struggling with the winter
blues for the first time here are some suggestions for feeling better and
staying healthy1 NutritionMost likely you have
heard the term comfort food These foods and snacks are high in
carbohydrates sugar and fat Avoid overeating cookies cakes and candy Chose
vegetables fruit and protein for snacks and plan balanced meals If you find
yourself wanting to eat or snack throughout the day ask yourself why you are
eating Are you hungry Or Are you eating because you are bored2 AlcoholKeep in mind that alcohol is a depressant so consuming wine
beer or liquor when already feeling sad anxious or depressed will only add to
your symptoms Do not consume alcohol while engaging in outdoor activities such
as snow removal skiing or ice fishing If you find yourself reaching for an
additional glass of wine or beer be mindful and ask whether you are doing it
due to boredom Instead of mindlessly taking another glass of alcohol drink a
glass of water 3 SunlightGet
out in the sunlight or brightly lit spaces especially early in the day4 Be activeIf you are unable to go to your favorite gym exercise class
or go for a run find a way to stay active in your home There are a lot of
short instructional programs available on YouTube that you can follow to do
some gently yoga dance or do strengthening exercises using only your body
weight5 Reach out for help
Confide in someone you trust about how you are feeling Do
not hesitate to contact a counselor if you feel that you are becoming more
depressed and anxious If you experience thoughts of suicide call the National

that first paragraph in your question Because that could describe more
introverted behavior people who feel more energy from a more internal approach
as opposed to those who feel more energy from being among others It is more
in the second paragraph that I would be inclined to say that further
exploration is definitely needed The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder is
more than just those two symptoms but there are more mild forms of depression
that can be equally damaging to someone if left untreatedHowever one of the trickiest parts of this is that someone who
feels they are not worth knowing may also believe they are not worth having a
therapist know them and even less worthy of being helped Do you feel that
might be you If so could we acknowledge that as a part of the big picture
and all wrapped up in these feelings about yourself and realizing that
thoughts and feelings arent always rational in that you are worth getting the
helpMy recommendation just from the information would be that you seek
out a supportive listening ear in the form of a therapist who can allow you
the space to express some of these difficult experiences and help you name FOR
YOURSELF what your struggle is To empower you to name it for yourself as
opposed to everyone labeling andor judging you for it might be an extremely
worthwhile start for you"	0	47	train

to tap into our own experience to help us connect with others in order to be
aware of how they are experiencing life
It is a skill that we learn with practice and refine as we become mature
If you are feeling anxious maybe you are able to understand better others who
are going trough anxiety But I wonder
if instead of feeling empathy you may just want to find ways to reduce your
anxiety A good idea is to be very aware
of your anxiety triggers and once you identify them explore other ways you
could reactSera normal que no sienta empataParece que no puedo experimentar ninguna otra emocin que
no sea ansiedad ni si quiera por m mismaEmpata es la habilidad de usar tus propias

And if so how old are you Is it ok to have sex do you want to have
sex It sounds like you want to make
your partner happy and that you are taking care of protecting yourself and
your partner but maybe you are forgetting to consider what do you really want Having sexual relations is a very personal decision
you and your partner have to consent It
is also important to talk about the possible consequences and being responsible
for them as well But sex should be something

that people find more personal than their sexual relationships When we feel
connected to our partner sex can be best thing since sliced bread However if
we feel disconnected in some way sex can feel degrading and even painful 
I dont know the specifics about your relationship or how
comfortable you are in talking to your boyfriend but this is one of those
situations where communicating your fears is a good idea The only exception to
that would be if you believe he is actually a threat to you in some way If you
believe that then you should do whatever you think is safe It sounds like
there is a part of you that is already afraid of him and if that is the case
then remaining safe is your top priority 
Assuming you are able to share with him your feelings
telling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate
and sexually healthy Sex is something that is supposed to be enjoyable for
all parties All parties should feel respected and able to say no to
absolutely anything they are not comfortable with 
I call the respectful agreement between sexual partners sex
trust Sex Trust means your partner respects your boundaries It means they
wont degrade you sexually with hurtful words forced sex or forcing or
coercing sex in ways someone is not interested in having Your personal safety and mental wellbeing is
what is most important 
Now if there is a part of you that is curious about BDSM
and may be interested in participating in it there are many websites that you
can explore to learn information I will warn you some websites and articles
are better or worse than others but you may at least feel more informed 
Many people engage in BDSM and have happy relationships but
again it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants It is
also important to know that BDSM is notjust one thing and people practice it
differently based on comfort If it is something you are uncomfortable with
then you shouldnt feel obligated to do it

I hope this was helpful Be well

is responsible for regulating the heart digestion respiratory rate
as well as other aspects which match the symptoms you describe It is largely an unconscious function but
with training it can be managed such as a public speaking course in which you
prepare and even have some exposure to smaller experiences to help you prepare
and cope for larger presentations One of the greatest applications of
addressing this response is the NASA program which exposes the astronauts to situations
they will encounter while in space which will trigger the response so that when
it does happen not if but when that they are able to move through the
challenge with success You can learn
more about his by going to TED Talks What I learned about going blind in space It is
a truly inspiring look at what you are experiencing as well as how to deal with

adult by state law with regard to counseling states differ on this
 the range is typically between age 13 and age 18 no one is allowed to
be in the session without the childs consentSecond ethical and legal standards generally require that a
counselor be in the role of a therapist or in the role of an evaluator but
not both This means that a counselor
should not generally provide both counseling and offer an opinion regarding who should
have custody of a childThird knowing the details of any parenting plan or
separation agreement is important
Generally either parent can consent to counseling for a minor child and
can be present during the childs sessions
If a court order parenting plan or separation agreement specifies that
one of the parents has sole decision making authority then only that parent can
consent to counseling for the minor child and only that parent can be present during the childs
sessionsIn a situation like this I would strongly recommend seeking
out legal advice specific to your state law"	1	278	train

two demons start out as pesky and little when we are young then grow with us to
become quite formidable Id like to throw in a technique I learned from Randy
Rausch author ofThe Last Lecturecalled The 3Step Apology
I teach this important bit of wisdom to my clients when they need to apologize
to someone else but more importantly when they need to forgive themselvesYes when we have trouble forgiving ourselves we sometimes forget
that there is part of us that just doesnt know how to apologize effectively
Here goesStep One Say what you did and the damage it causedStep Two Say youre sorry and accept full
responsibility no excuses no explanation no defensiveness It was all my
faultStep
Three Ask what you can do to repair the damageStep Three is the one many of us didnt learn growing up And when
we add it to an apology we are usually surprised that the penalty is as light
as it is Of course sometimes the apology is not accepted and no way to atone
is offered So be it we cant control this But if we are apologizing to
ourselves we can There is always a way to make amends if we put our heart
into it
Give this a try the next time youre reluctant to let yourself off
the hook You might surprise yourself when how benevolent you can be when

Online	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsrafaelmorales	Previous counselors have discussed very good points about your situation so I would like just to confirm what seems essential to me on this topicWhen you ask yourself this question it shows you are not happy or have doubts about the way things have evolved so far Relationships require time and work for them to develop grow and flourish as healthy and fulfilling ones for both partners This is a key factor reciprocity Without both of you sharing the same core values beliefs expectations and lifestyles without you having a good level of compatibility in your personalities and feeling understood protected cared by supported and loved by each other there is no way you could truly feel and experience a mutually healthy meaningful and fulfilling relationship for the long runWhat has attracted you to each other is good and meaningful enough to empower and support you for the long run Many people focus too much on looks financial benefits or other external factors which are important but cannot build a healthy mature and fulfilling lifelong relationship This does not mean many couples do not willingly choose these types of relationship since truly believing those are their top priorities What they ignore is that with time life challenges issues and pain temptations and appealing alternatives around those external factors their relationships would not cope very well but would get gradually or suddenly underminedBe honest with yourself reflect on what you truly need want and expect from a boyfriend and life partner Ask yourself if this person has what it takes to meet those expectations and satisfy those needs and if you are also a very good match for him since there is no way the relationship works unless it does for both of you So while one person could feel blessed by having such a wonderful partner the other could feel frustrated or just not truly fulfilled passionate or happy with herhis partnerLongterm relationships require a lot and when I talk about sharing same core factors I mean truly feeling being a good match to each other at the physical mental emotional and spiritual levels and around all the other roles life involves related to lifestyle as social life habits dreams preferences etcThen there is a lot to reflect on by yourself to carefully evaluate in yourself based on what you already know about you and this person Then you would be able to tell yourself if you truly want to continue or not with this person If you feel you do then you have to talk to him and make sure he feels the same way In a scenario where you doubt if you should tell him about this or that as another counselor suggested out of fear of any form of abuse or retaliation those would be serious enough to show you this could never truly work If your fears are more about being misunderstood and judged then you still have to work on developing open and honest communication with him as long as what you expect is something truly healthy and worthyMany people look for and stay in relationships because they prefer that to be alone by themselves thus they end using relationships to feel better about themselves and their lives to bring some feelings of happiness and company The problem is that if those are the initial core reasons to start or stay in a relationship this can never truly evolve into anything healthy and mutually fulfilling unless the person works on herselfhimself to meet those personal needs and resolve those personal issues which would enable her to work on self and with the other person in the relationshipFinally I want to mention what I shared in a past article on this subject namely you need to assess if your boyfriend has been really consistent in his words and actions otherwise lack of honesty accountability andor respect would never lead to anything worthy in any type of relationships Also we are all human beings and that means we are no perfect and we need to work on ourselves to make improvements Relationships are a means to keep growing as individuals supporting each other to become better versions of ourselves without manipulation neglect or abuse Thus while on one hand healthy love means embracing the whole persona with strengths and weaknesses on the other hand it is fully incompatible with tolerating andor enabling what is distorted or dysfunctional against that person or against ourselves This is why both persons need to be willing and ready to work on making changes and improvements as necessary Without this it would be hopeless and helpless to expect things would be just fine with time they would not they would just get worseSo lets take one step at a time reflect on what you feel need and want now and for the future assess how well this person is able and willing to work on that and dialogue to make sure you are both fully aware understood and clear about your relationship and how well it could make your lives better If professional support is needed and both are willing to take it please do not delay it If one refuses necessary support then face reality and come to terms with what it is showing you Trust more actions than words set and keep healthy boundaries and take into account what life experiences show you as well as feedback and counsel from those mature and truly caring people who know you while pushing away what is superficial biased or too rushedThank you for sharing	0	288	train

it like that For example she gets offended when I call someone at work sweetheart I wish I had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her She doesnt and never will say she was wrong How do I get her to understand	httpscounselchatcomquestionswhydoifeellikeimalwayswrongineverythinginmyrelationship	workplacerelationships	Virginia ChowTheraspace	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsvirginiachow	Hello That must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault This could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the longterm Based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wifes side of the story I would say that you are raising 3 different concernsOne is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified It may bear clarifying how each of you define infidelity Currently there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hookup chatroom texting extensive phone calls to a female friend viewing pornography a massage with happy ending physical intercourse or intimate emotional sharing Depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities If there is no truth to it then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying I feel you distancing from me In other words its not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her Often times accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness If so what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally If this is true you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again Otherwise if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needsThe second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a sweetheart The term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean youre so sweet and kind my dear or in a flirtatious manner to mean sweetie The intention behind the use is known only to the speaker You may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife If your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said If she finds the term disrespectful it may be her way of expressing I want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that I am not valued as much Therefore arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark Rather the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings You may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you Is saying sweetheart to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife That said if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding accomodating and prioritizing her needs then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities She may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fearsThe last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting shes wrong Indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong In the absence of her admitting to any faults it could seem like you are the one with the problem Unfortunately blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy This pattern can also trigger the partners insecurity as they witnesses the distancing which could make them angrier and more accusatory  creating a vicious cycle Finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment This kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding We sometimes take for granted the simple expression of Im sorry However it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that In my practice when a client tells me that his or her partner never says Im sorry I am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability If neither of them express it then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesnt do it These insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientatingFor more information about these services you are welcome to read my materials on my website at wwwPsychologyResourceca or

there lived a village of creatures along the bottom of a great crystal
river The current of the river swept silently over them all  young and
old rich and poor good and evil  the current going its own way knowing
only its own crystal self
Each creature in its own
manner clung tightly to the twigs and rocks of the river bottom for clinging
was their way of life and resisting the current was what each had learned
from birth
But one creature said
at last I am tired of clinging Though I cannot see it with my eyes
I trust that the current knows where it is going I shall let go and let
it take me where it will Clinging I shall die of boredom
The other creatures laughed
and said Fool Let go and that current you worship will throw you tumbled
and smashed against the rocks and you will die quicker than boredom
But the one heeded them
not and taking a breath did let go and at once was tumbled and smashed
by the current across the rocks
Yet in time as the creature
refused to cling again the current lifted him free from the bottom and
he was bruised and hurt no more
And the creatures downstream
to whom he was a stranger cried See a miracle A creature like ourselves
yet he flies See the messiah come to save us all
And the one carried in
the current said I am no more messiah than you The river delights to
lift us free if only we dare let go Our true work is this voyage this
adventure
But they cried the more
Savior all the while clinging to the rocks and when they looked again
he was gone and they were left alone making legends of a savior"	0	147	train

the root of it can shed some light on what the problem is and can provide some
relief in itself I would also suggest doing some selfexploration and see a
therapist for individual sessions in order to gain a clearer insight as to what
the cause is There are also several actions you can take on your own to help
control your anger and communicate more effectivelyHere is what I would recommend
you try
Take time outs When you feel yourself becoming upset excuse yourself and
take a time out to either think about the most appropriate course of
actionor redirect your thoughts all together Often when webecome
angry it is difficult to see the issue clearly as our emotionsget in
the way
Do deep breathing exercises Close your eyes Breathe in slowly to the
count of 4 Breathe out even slower to the count of 6 Practice this for about
5 minutes 3 times a day and focus on nothing except your breathing during this
time Once it becomes routine for you it will be easier to apply during
situations in which you are angry or upset
Change negative thought patterns Try and recall or be aware of your
thoughts particularly when you are feeling angry What are these thoughts
telling you Are they valid or logical Is there factual evidence to support
the negative thoughts Often the answer is no Learn to stop the
negative thoughts and replace them with logical andmore positive
ones
Communicate effectively As a speaker you want to use I
statements by telling the other person how you feel instead of blaming himher
by using you statements For example you might say something such
as I feel sad when you dont come home at a decent hour and I dont get
to spend time with you versus You always stay out late and dont
even care about me The speaker should also avoid using black and white
language such as always never etc As the listener you want to validate what
you hear so that the other person knows that you are listening You will also want
to be responsive and offer fair solutions
I wish you luck in using these tools and learning about where your anger comes

resourceful young person to reach out like this to find help Good for you I
have a few ideas and perhaps some other counselors will add some thoughts too

First good for you for taking care of yourself and making
really good decisions  such as not getting into the car with dad when he is
intoxicated It is really important that you consider your safety above all
else 
To answer your heading question yes it is quite common for
people to blame themselves for other peoples actions There are various
reasons why we do this For one thing someone may tell us that their behaviors are our fault And depending on things like our relationship to that
person past experiences and our selfesteem we may actually start to believe
it What is important to remember is that your parents have the responsibility
to be sure that you are safe and
cared for not the other way around 
As for the other things you mentioned I am concerned about both
your physical and emotional safety and wellbeing It sounds like your father
has an alcohol abuse problem and living with someone who is struggling with
addiction can be hard for anyone let alone a teenager who is also trying to
deal with things like school 
You may want to see if your school has a counselor or
someone you can talk to about what is going on I will tell you that in some
states what you have told me may be something that a counselor would have to
report to child protection services but not necessarily If you are concerned
about that ask the counselor what they are obligated to report 
If you dont know a counselor think about any other adult
that you would feel comfortable talking to They may have some ideas 
Sometimes individual states have nonprofit chat lines or
hotlines for teens to call if they are struggling with things You may be able
to find something like that in your state I do warn your about doing random
searches not every website is good so be careful 
This is clearly a tough spot for you to be in so one of the
things that I encourage you to do while searching for support is to focus on
taking care of yourself Sometimes things like this can really bring us down and
we stop doing the things we enjoy Try really hard not to let that happen If
you have interests do them If you catch yourself thinking too hard about
things try to find something fun to do to distract yourself Try to take care
of yourself in other ways such as eating well Exercise can really help when
we get stressed 
I hope some of this was helpful Good luck

possible for us to get past the cheating or should I just move on	httpscounselchatcomquestionsisitpossibleforacoupletoovercomecheatingifitonlyhappenedonce	intimacy	Ashlie BrownCounselor  Hypnotherapist	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsashliebrown	I think there are many different directions we could go as far as answering your question I think the first and most important question you need to ask yourself is do you truly believe in your heart that you can forgive him and trust him again Once you answer that question honestly then you can move in one of two directions First if you truly love this guy and see yourself being with him long term and for the long haul so to speakand you genuinely want to forgive him and trust him again that is completely doable and possible if you both put in the work But theres a greater issue here that needs to be addressed You say your relationship is good but theres been a sexual disconnect between the two of you and that usually indicates some type of emotional disconnect is at the core Would you agree with that or what are your thoughts Were you giving him less sexual attention than you normally do or were you guys never on the same page about sexual needs and having compatible sex drives If you are more of an emotional person than he is you may have been less interested sexually because he hasnt been meeting your emotional needs For instance if you hadnt been feeling loved cared about validated appreciated cherished and special to him than you may have felt less connected physically and been less interested This is a common issue with couples and can easily be addressed if the communication in your relationship is strong and you can find a way to express to him your frustrations In essence many women tend to have more emotional needs than men this is the way we are hardwired and there are exceptions to this of course but if you have been feeling neglected emotionally than your lack of interest in sex is actually completely understandable and NORMAL Until he understands this and can learn to tune into your needs emotionally you may struggle with feeling you are out of sync emotionally and sexually This leads to you both being frustrated but if all this is ringing true to you he seriously probably has no clue whats going on and may not know how youre feeling You need to communicate your needs to him if you are super lost with how to do that theres an awesome book called The Five Love Languages Its not that long and its very approachable and easy to apply the concepts to your relationships Invaluable resource for relationships and truly eye opening reallyThis is a long post Im sorry But this is such an important issue that is very common and many people feel lost about how to handle it So back to the second direction you can goyou feel very betrayed you arent sure if you can ever trust him again and you see yourself perhaps being paranoid forever and never being able to completely get over this For instance if he says he is working late or if he doesnt call or text right away when he usually does you may immediately jump to the worst case scenario that he is cheating again Of course it may not be true he may have legit reasons for his behaviors but the point is if you are going to be in paranoiamode OR you just will always be unsure whether he loves you and is committed to you and only you then the trust may not be able to be rebuilt You need to think long and hard about this and if you decide you have the capacity to forgive him and rebuild your foundation of trust and honesty then you need to let him know very explicitly what you need him to do to earn that trust back You cant just tell him vaguely I need to trust you again if he wants his family back and hes willing to do the work you need to line out exactly what he needs to do and he needs to do it But be prepared that he might throw out there that he cheated because he felt you werent attracted to him anymore or he tries to put the blame on you somehow because he says you werent meeting his physical needsif he throws that out there but you werent showing him the affection because you were frustrated emotionally then it all starts with you communicating that to him Get that bookIn conclusion if you feel in your heart there is no way you will be able to trust him again and you will always wonder if hes cheating when his behavior isnt spot on you will be a nervous wreck and perhaps cutting your losses now would spare you the continued heartache There is certainly a way to work through this but you both have to be motivated and you have to get to the source of why the cheating happened in the first place Rebuilding trust can be a long process maybe even years and for some people they may never be able to fully trust and let go of the past I truly recommend starting with the book and then going from there If you decide you want to stay with him you would really benefit from couples counseling as it sounds like a professional could help you strengthen your communication and ability to trust again	0	190	val

had to address with individuals often since working with couples is one of my
practices focuses The answer can depend upon several reasons all which
tend to be explored while in session If you or your counselor utilizes
an integral approach in which one of the main premises makes sure to check the
four irreducible perspectives subjective intersubjective objective and
interobjective  also known as the four quadrants in determining where the
challenges are it then becomes possible to identify what might be contributing
to or causing the challenge as well as offering up ways to address the
situationIn this case from the upperright
or behavioral and physical perspective we would want to make sure there is no
physical limitation or ailment meaning that you would need to visit your doctor
and have the basics checked such as blood pressure We would also look at particular behaviors to
see if you are doing something with is effecting performance such as
masturbating often or being influenced by pornographyNext we would look at the
upper left quadrant thoughts cognitions identity feelings to look at what
is going on here both during sexual activities and at other times If you are worried about your job your
family or under immense pressure to perform at work or while intimate this can
contribute to your situation From there
we would turn to the lower left quadrant cultural rules and tools to see who
you have learned to interpret challenges that come up during sex and look for
ways to shift update andor reshape the way you view sex and its
challenges It would be here that we
would see whether one is even comfortable using a service like counseling based
upon how your familyculture of origin views the professionFinally we would need to
account for challenges that show up in the lower right quadrant systems laws
rules of society such as your economic ability to try services and products as
well as whether such services and products were even available Once we have rolled through these areas it
then becomes possible to look at which aspects might need to be looked at
further in a more meaningful way to help you change a perspective or if just
getting a blood pressure medication is all you needTo sum your question then
of why you cant keep an erection we would need to look at your thoughts look
at your actual thoughts during the act as well as before and after look at
your behaviors look at your physical body for issues look at where you picked
up your rules and tools culture and look at your ability to access goods and
services They all contribute equally
and need to be taken into account So  as you can see there is no one possible answer to this but several I hope this helps"	0	94	val

1226	524	Is it wrong to cheat on my husband	We dont have sex a lot I cheat when we argue I dont kiss or have unprotected sex with them Its a one time thing and I never see them twice	httpscounselchatcomquestionsisitwrongtocheatonmyhusband	intimacy	Robin Landwehr DBH LPCC NCCMental Health in a Primary Care Setting	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsrobinlandwehrdbhlpccncc	"Hello and thank you for your question The question about
whether or not to cheat is based on personal values that can only be answered
by you However here are a few things to consider and questions to ask
yourself to help you find your answer
1
Do you feel like you are violating your own
values or morals This is important because we all have different values and
morals surrounding sex love and monogamy If you value monogamous
relationships and find yourself cheating on your partner then you may feel
like you are living in contradiction to your values and most people are not
happy when they do that However if monogamy is not something you value then
perhaps it is time to reevaluate the relationship and determine if it is still
right for you Not all people want monogamous relationships and that
is alright Finallyif you value your husbands feelings and know that the
affairs would hurt him then your behaviors may again be in contrast to your
own values That can only be determined by you 
2Based on how you describe your relationship it
sounds like you are not very satisfied with the way it is From the outside it looks like the affairs
are a way to get even with your husband or to feel better after an argument This
is something that can happen when mutual respect starts to fade in a
relationship and gets replaced with contempt We can simply stop caring about
how our actions hurt each other or potentially hurt each other Perhaps the
question to ask here is when you look out toward the future with your husband
is this the pattern that you want to keep The pattern of very little sex
argument and then satisfying the pain or dissatisfaction with affairs 
3What are your goals for this relationship If we
start to become disconnected in a relationship we can begin to do things on
autopilot Get up get the kids up go to work come home and go to bed None
of which requires any intimacy at all Are you still able to see the hopes and
dreams you once had for this relationship
4
Have you considered seeking marital counseling Not
having affairs wont actually fix the part of the relationship that is leading
you to have them If there is something broken it sometimes requires some help
to get it fixed 
Hopefully these questions and thoughts will help you come to
some kind of conclusion about what is right for you and your relationship I certainly
wish you well

   The baby was a few months old and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her He told me how he could never stop talking to her and how during our issues she has been and is the only women hes gone behind my back with but on a friendship level because shes miles away He confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like hes possibly in love with her too He said he feels like hes in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him and she hasnt been able to leave him alone since Even though she knows that hes still with me and happy with our family she cant help it and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual Being that he loves me too he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time He wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels but he didnt want me to find out so he told me everything He said he didnt want to continue to lie to me and so I can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when its only been this one girl the whole time He feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her and that no matter what he did to do right I would still accuse him Hes caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesnt want me to leave him because Im the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life

difficult because it is often misunderstood even by people who are supposed
to be part of your own community such as lesbians and gays It happens so
often that there is actually a term for it 
bierasure This is simply something that happens when people deny that
bisexuality is a real thing or discriminate against bisexuals due to beliefs
like your parents seem to have 
The unfortunate truth is that you can never
be sure of how you parents may take this kind of information It sounds
promising that they are accepting of other sexual orientations and it may
simply be that your parents lack education about bisexuality With accurate
information they may come around but there is no way to be sure 
Some of my colleagues have already given you good information Here are some morethings that you can consider
and questions you can ask yourself before making the decision to tell them

1 If they dont respond the way you want them to have you developed a support
system to support you through it This is very important The truth is that all
the friends in the world wont prevent pain or sadness if your parents dont
respond as you hope but they will at least be there to remind you that you ARE
okay as you are And that is critical for you to remember 

2 There is great information on the internet about bisexuality that you can
offer your parents if you think it would be helpful It may be important for
them to know the kind of damage that is being done to bisexual adults and young
people because of the myths surrounding bisexuality Here is an article from
GLAAD about bierasure httpwwwglaadorgbisexualbierasure

3 Coming out to people is obviously deeply personal and should only take
place when you are ready Sometimes people get pressured from friends media
and even people they are romantically involved with to come out before they are
ready It really is up to you If you are feeling pressure from others dont
feel bad about setting your boundaries and telling them that you will come out
on your own time Intimate partners should respect you enough to understand
this 

4 Something else to think about is your own comfort in being bisexual Just
because someone is LGBTQ doesnt mean that they necessarily want to be Many
people struggle with this Having
your own doubts or insecurities may also play a part in how comfortable you are
in telling your parents So perhaps do some selfexploration about your
feelings toward yourself 

Sometimes people take friends with them
when they decide to come out to their parents This is something you may want
to consider The important thing to remember is that you are okay Really If
your parents dont respond well that doesnt mean that they never will Some
start off upset but then work their way through it 
Best of luck to you

   The point is there is so much drama I try my best to get along with everyone I dont understand where I went wrong besides replying back to his question I feel like Im going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyones frustrations are taken out on each other and its the children that are hurting I had a party planned for my daughters birthday and my exboyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldnt let me have her In my eyes its the child that is hurting I was throwing a party for her birthday and because of the problem with stupid pickup details about my stepdaughter which I have no control over he took it out on our daughter"	httpscounselchatcomquestionsmyexboyfriendwouldntletmehavemydaughterbecauseididntknowmystepdaughterspickupdetails	familyconflict	Lynda MartensMarriage  Family Therapist MSc RP RMFT	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsmslyndamartenslondonontario	Hi I appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation I agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the childrenChildren need adults around them to act maturely cooperatively and peacefully even when they dont like each other it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing Your exboyfriendseems more focused on his own needs In fact he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive controlling and manipulative bordering on parental alienation I agree this is a problemI also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy Its not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress Honour this instinct you haveI will suggest a few things to you First to gather support around you professionally if you need it from family and friends and certainly from your husband If you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex that will help He can help run interference when it comes to his daughter It will help you feel supportedKnow that your exs behaviours arent happening because you did anything wrong its the way he operates and maybe this is why youre not with him You cant change him but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression Youre correct that he will always be there and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situationKeep on defining clear boundaries You might sound like a broken record Youll have to talk to my husband about that but thats okay Its okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle Its okay to not respond to texts or other communications that arent vitally important Its okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable Its okay to not engage with him more than is necessaryRegarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you I recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully Let him know what your expectations are simply and clearly and in writing our agreement states X and you are not following our agreement Your daughter doesnt have to be aware I think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflictA professional therapist can help you with all of this I hope this helps get you started towards greater peace at least within yourself 	1	117	train

doesnt respect or treat you well can be enormously difficult and painful 
Many people who find themselves in an emotionally hurtful
relationship say that it was wonderful when it first started but that over
time their partners behaviors changed and they became emotionally or
physically abusive 
I want to say right away that it is not your fault in any
way if someone is abusive to you It does not mean that you are broken or that there
is something wrong with your character if you have not left the situation
People stay for many reasons such as fear finances children pressure from
others and love 
Many people have had to leave their abusive partners who
they still love to preserve their own safety and regain the sense of self they
may have lost It is a very difficult thing to do even if you know it is the
right thing 
The person who really needs to take a hard look at
themselves is the person doing the abusing
It is very common for mental and emotional abuse to wear
away at someones selfesteem This can lead to other problems like depression
and anxiety These issues sometimes require professional support to manage
such as a counselor or perhaps a doctor who may prescribe medication 
A counselor may be able to help you sort through your fears
and concerns about staying or leaving To look at things from different angles
and to help you decide what is best for you 
You have not said that your husband has been physically abusive
to you but if that has been the case then you must consider your physical
safety first Leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous time
Getting help from professionals would be critical and I would recommend your
local domestic violence program 
Whatever you decide to do is the right thing for you I
would encourage you to ask yourself honestly about your reasons for staying and
the barriers that may keep you from going You do deserve to be happy and
emotionally safe If you do not feel like you have that safety then seeking
someone to help you sort through these things is a good plan 
I wish you well

yourself is vulnerable and being vulnerable is hard It takes courage and work
to be vulnerable My guess is that you have been shown in your lifetime that
being vulnerable ie expressing yourself is unsafe My assumption would be
you have been criticized or ignored when you have expressed yourself in the
past it has taught your emotional self to simply not do it again This is a normal
protective mechanism that you have used to cope with past feelings of hurt It
will take time and work to engage again in an emotional wayI would start my practicing and
identifying how you feel to yourself Check in with yourself multiple times a
day to gage where you are at emotionally After you feel you have a good grasp
on this start to engage in emotional conversations with others Choose others that
feel safe to you a good friend that knows you well or a sibling or family
member Expressing yourself is a behavior that you have suppressed out of
protection so you can choose to engage in safe emotional expression behaviors

your own question by stating that you love cross dressing very much and I am
glad you enjoy it Cross dressing is something many people enjoy and there is
no harm in it whatsoeverMy question to you would be What is making you feel torn
about it There is unfortunately still a lot of negative stigma associated with
people who express their gender or sexuality in ways that differ from the
majority And sometimes certain sexual interests are actually very common or
even in the majority but because people carry shame about being different when
it comes to gender and sexuality we assume we are all aloneBeing a sexual or gender minority or someone who
participates in kink or expresses their sexuality or gender identity in a
unique and personal way often means suffering from something called
internalized oppression We grow up being exposed to certain
assumptions and beliefs about what is acceptable behavior and even
face consequences sometimes if we dont fit in the way others tell
us to Even if those assumptions are harmful and wrong we still internalize
them and feel guilty about who we are There is nothing wrong with us but
feeling stigmatized and isolated can lead to feelings of shame embarrassment
or like something is wrong with usBut there is absolutely nothing wrong with you so be proud
of who you are and what you enjoy You can continue to simply enjoy it
privately or maybe youd eventually like to share it with a partner or maybe
even join a community with similar interests Ill leave you with a quote from

feelings and desires it could certainty shake everything you thought you knew
about yourself 
My guess is that you becoming sick around the time that this
started is likely a coincidence but I understand how you would make the
connection 
I have a feeling that a few things may be going on here It
is really hard to say since I dont know you how old you are etc But I will
share you with you some thoughts 
Some people when they have undesirable thoughts that really
surprise them have a really tough time getting rid of them Our reaction to
the thought can be very strong and our tendency to try to block it out stuff
it avoid it etc is not always successful In fact its usually not 
Its like telling you not to think of pink elephants I
would be willing to bet that you thought of a pink elephant just now 
So rather than fighting thoughts that you find confusing
sometimes it is helpful to allow yourself to explore the thought with curiosity
and without judgement Where is this thought coming from What are my feelings
about it Asking yourself these questions may help you come to a resolution
about what is going on 
One possibility is that you have developed an anxiety about
your thoughts and now you are in the process of obsessing about them but
another possibility is that you are legitimately exploring your sexuality and
gender I get the feeling from your question that you do not want to believe
that it is second possibility And that is okay 
You can try some of my suggestions but you can also see a
counselor who may be able to help you work through your confusion I would
suggest someone who has experience working with sexuality issues You can
usually find out what a counselor works with on their website What is
important is that you find someone who is nonjudgmental about what you are
experiencing

Chances are most of the goodbyes you have experienced in your life have been
difficult Saying goodbye to a therapist can be different It can be an
opportunity to create a healthy ending in a positive relationship in your life
If you work with a therapist who is skilled then saying goodbye can be just as
transformative as the therapy itself Ending therapy is also known
as termination I know termination doesnt have a great ring to it
However it is what it is It is an ending of the relationship as it existed
It is reality cold and stark Of course when I talk to clients I dont use the
word termination I usually say our goodbye Under what circumstances does therapy usually
end Therapy should end when a client does not need further assistance is not
receiving any benefit from therapy or might be harmed by continuing to work
with a particular therapistIn the best case scenario
the decision to move on from therapy and say our goodbyes happens when both
the therapist and the client feel like the client is ready to move on and move
up Ending the therapeutic relationship
should actually be worked on from the very first session What I mean by that
is there should be an understanding that the work we do together will have an
ending and that is a good thing because it means the client has gained the
skills to continue working on themselves independently So the first session I
have with clients usually outlines a plan where the end goal is discussed and
we both have an understanding of the skills the client wants to learn or what
they hope to achieve Now sometimes there are
situations where the therapist ends the relationship and the client may take
that personally it is hard when any relationship ends and it might bring up
feelings of sadness and fear or abandonment Any good therapist will end the
relationship based on what is right for the client What are some situations
where a therapist might end the relationshipIf the situation the client
is dealing with is out of the therapists scope of practice the therapist may
end the relationship and refer the client to someone else This is in the
clients best interest Another reason a therapist might end the relationship
is that the therapist is in a place in her life which prevents her from being
objective and helpful A therapist who
is going through a painful divorce may have difficulty working with a couple
that considering divorce A good therapist may see that their judgement may be
clouded and want to refer the client to see someone else This is good practice
and helps the clientIf a client is actively
suicidal or actively using substances then the therapist may end the
relationship and refer out for a higher level of care The client may need to
be hospitalized or may need an inpatient substance abuse treatment program
Therapy may be terminated while they are being treated and may continue after
the intensive program is completed
Ending therapy should be a
time for connection and bringing together accomplishments or reviewing the
next important step the client needs to take It should not be an experience of
abandonment A skilled therapist will help a client gain a new perspective on
closure For some clients it may be the one time in their lives when they get
a clean ending in a healthy relationship and they get to feel a sense of
control on creating that endingGood luck to you"	0	139	train

to and most of us have to work at itcertainly at first Im here to tell you
that living in the now or being mindful is a skill anyone can learn Unfortunately
the only way to do it is to do it What a paradox But there are plenty of
other skills that we are not born with walking on stilts riding a bike
swimming and driving a car are good examples You cant learn them by reading about
themHaving said that I can recommend two books on
the subject Eckhart Tolles The Power of
Now and David Richos When the Past
is Present Richo asks that we dont beat ourselves up about dwelling on
past events This is natures way of reminding us that we have unfinished
business But while we are attended to the wounds and confusion that litter our earlier lives we can prepare to inhabit the expanded present that awaits usHe offers three helpful steps to making any important life
changeStep One Hold in awareness the behavior
belief attitude or characteristic you want to change in yourself and how you
want to be different Awareness is the opposite of distraction and stuffingStep Two Live as if you have
already made the change This is hard and takes courage but you can do it
Ride that bikeeven if for a foot or twoStep Three Be persistent

Chances are most of the goodbyes you have experienced in your life have been
difficult Saying goodbye to a therapist can be different It can be an
opportunity to create a healthy ending in a positive relationship in your life
If you work with a therapist who is skilled then saying goodbye can be just as
transformative as the therapy itself Ending therapy is also known
as termination I know termination doesnt have a great ring to it
However it is what it is It is an ending of the relationship as it existed
It is reality cold and stark Of course when I talk to clients I dont use the
word termination I usually say our goodbye Under what circumstances does therapy usually
end Therapy should end when a client does not need further assistance is not
receiving any benefit from therapy or might be harmed by continuing to work
with a particular therapistIn the best case scenario
the decision to move on from therapy and say our goodbyes happens when both
the therapist and the client feel like the client is ready to move on and move
up Ending the therapeutic relationship
should actually be worked on from the very first session What I mean by that
is there should be an understanding that the work we do together will have an
ending and that is a good thing because it means the client has gained the
skills to continue working on themselves independently So the first session I
have with clients usually outlines a plan where the end goal is discussed and
we both have an understanding of the skills the client wants to learn or what
they hope to achieve Now sometimes there are
situations where the therapist ends the relationship and the client may take
that personally it is hard when any relationship ends and it might bring up
feelings of sadness and fear or abandonment Any good therapist will end the
relationship based on what is right for the client What are some situations
where a therapist might end the relationshipIf the situation the client
is dealing with is out of the therapists scope of practice the therapist may
end the relationship and refer the client to someone else This is in the
clients best interest Another reason a therapist might end the relationship
is that the therapist is in a place in her life which prevents her from being
objective and helpful A therapist who
is going through a painful divorce may have difficulty working with a couple
that considering divorce A good therapist may see that their judgement may be
clouded and want to refer the client to see someone else This is good practice
and helps the clientIf a client is actively
suicidal or actively using substances then the therapist may end the
relationship and refer out for a higher level of care The client may need to
be hospitalized or may need an inpatient substance abuse treatment program
Therapy may be terminated while they are being treated and may continue after
the intensive program is completed
Ending therapy should be a
time for connection and bringing together accomplishments or reviewing the
next important step the client needs to take It should not be an experience of
abandonment A skilled therapist will help a client gain a new perspective on
closure For some clients it may be the one time in their lives when they get
a clean ending in a healthy relationship and they get to feel a sense of
control on creating that endingGood luck to you"	0	139	train

will be of significant help when the individual seeking therapy desires change
improvement and overall growth Most counseling involves homework and a level
of commitment outside of session that also contributes to resolution of
problems and an ability to cope with stresses in a productive way Here are
some of the key ways that therapy can help 
1 Helps to define the problem and gain a clearer
understanding of where it originates Many people seek counseling because of symptoms they are
experiencing These can include feeling sad increased sleeping substance use
panic attacks selfharm isolating ones self academic decline etc Often
times people are not aware of what is causing these symptoms Having a
therapist to help guide and explore why the symptoms are occurring and where
they come from will give individuals increased insight and awareness into their
problems 
2 Allows for a safe outlet to vent
Not everyone likes to share their problems with close
friends or family members Maybe they dont want others to know of their flaws
Maybe they dont want to burden others with their problems Or maybe they just
are not comfortable talking about themselves And in some situations people do
not have the option of talking with someone they know because they have no
friends or family While talking with those we know can help bring some relief
it is also nice to talk with someone like a therapist who is objective and
emotionally removed from given situations Counseling gives a safe outlet in
which one can express their personal feelings and thoughts without feeling
judged
3 Counselors can offer various problem solving solutions

A good therapist usually will not directly point their
client in the direction they need to go Counseling is about growth and
teaching the client to identify triggers and use effective coping strategies
that will bring about emotional and psychological relief Counselors will help
clients to explore the various options available in given situation based on
the clients needs wants and values and will help them to choose the option
that best fits with their desired outcome 
4 Gives one the tools needed to cope with current and future
problems
Many individuals that seek therapy have never learned
good coping strategies Perhaps they did not have parents or caretakers to
model productive ways to cope or maybe the symptoms they are suffering from are
overbearing and take away the energy needed to cope Different diagnoses
require different tools however some are beneficial for any problem and any
individual These include but are not limited to relaxation techniques
breathing exercises development of healthy routines using mindfulness
improving communication skills and recognizing and changing maladaptive
thought patterns A good counselor will teach clients how to use these tools
will often practice them during session and will assign homework for further
practice and mastery of the skills"	0	314	train
