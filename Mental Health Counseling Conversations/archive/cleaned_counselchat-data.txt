5566fab2a64752d71ec3ca69	Escalating disagreements between mother and wife	"My wife and mother are having tense disagreements In the past theyve had minor differences For example my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing my mother would complain my wife is lazy
However its intensified lately I think the cause is my wife talked back to her once Now any little disagreement is magnified leading to major disagreements What can I do"	httpscounselchatcomquestionsescalatingdisagreementsbetweenmotherandwife	Family Conflict	Kristi KingMorgan LMSW	httpscounselchatcomtherapistskristikingmorganlmsw	What you are describing is something psychologists have termed triangulation which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead You have been triangulated by your wife and motherThis is often seen in families Its seen everywhere How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didnt go to them to tell them you went to someone else to complain It is usually difficult for a person to confront another especially in relationships where there is a power differential For example I bet its easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaintIm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree Thats what therapists do every day Sometimes just getting someone elses perspective can help you see the issue clearer However in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you loveIf you want to put a stop to this triangulation you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up Even if they really dont like each other and cant get along your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middleTry to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife I heard one motherinlaw describe her sons wife as the gateway to her son The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren If your wife doesnt like her motherinlaw she can severely hamper or damage her motherinlaws relationship with you and any children you two may have From your wifes viewpoint this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to If you regularly praise your moms cooking her housework gardening or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated This can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike I am not saying that this is the case with your familys situation These are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yoursRegardless of what the cause is if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you dont agree with them They will get upset if you dont align yourself with them against the other They will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other ones side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should In worst cases if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other ending that relationship Change the dynamics before it spirals even further	0
5566f94fa64752d71ec3ca64	Im addicted to smoking How can I stop	"Im planning to have baby so I have to quit smoking  but its hard Sometimes its not a physical need its mental

I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking What can I do to get rid of this addiction"	httpscounselchatcomquestionsimaddictedtosmokinghowcanistop	Substance AbuseAddiction	Rebecca Duellman	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsrebeccaduellman	Hi Good for you in planning ahead to do whats healthiest for your baby and yourself Thats a great first step Its also good that you are able to identify that its not always a physical need thats driving the addictionFor the next steps I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur The psychological or mental cravings are usually based out of habit such as having a cigarette after a meal And if youre consciously trying to quit youll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel etc etc Well if Im on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer eventually Ill give in and eat itYoure going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette Thats normal and for the most part out of your control But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought Thats what you would have to work on changing When you have that initial thought acknowledge it Ok I kind of want a cigarette now but then change the thoughts that typically follow Distract yourself think about something else do something else whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigaretteIve suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what theyre going to do when the time comes Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it Eventually it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have itBest of luck and you have a really great motivator to quit  your baby	0

What should I do Its becoming annoying and making me anxious Help me out"	httpscounselchatcomquestionskeepingsecretsfrommyfamily	Family Conflict	Jeevna Bajaj	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsjeevnabajaj	It sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now There are several things to consider before you make a decision You mentioned that you dont want your wife and mom to know because you dont want to hurt them  why would it hurt them Is it necessary for them to know this information What are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling them for you and for your wife and mom Once you have considered these think of what you would tell your friend if they were in your exact situation Also if your wife or mom were in your situation right now what do you think they would do themselves If your wife and mom were in this situation how would you feel Would you want to know the secrets How has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical healthOnce you have looked at the problem from all angles you will be able to better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not	0

556ba115c969ba5861709de6	Can I control anxiety without medication	I had a head injury a few years ago and my mind races all the time I have trouble sleeping and have a lot of anxiety Every medicine I have been on my body rejects I get sick to my stomach and get blisters in my mouth How can I calm my self down Im a wreck	httpscounselchatcomquestionscanicontrolanxietywithoutmedication	Anxiety	Rebecca Duellman	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsrebeccaduellman	You didnt say what or how many medications youve tried Certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous but I havent heard of any that cause mouth blisters so there may be some other underlying medical issue there I would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if youve suffered a severe head injury There are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effectsBut beyond that have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation Meditation can be very effective but it takes practice and you dont have to sit crosslegged for hours chanting Ohm to meditate Its about focusing on your breath rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head And when they do take your mind off your breath simply refocus and refocus and refocus Like I said it takes practice so dont give up You can find many sites offering different ways to meditate so look around and see what works best for you Like medication you just have to find the one that works best and that might take some experimentationI hope this helps and best of luck to you	0
556b6940c969ba5861709de4	How do I break an unhealthy relationship pattern	"I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it
I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call
I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive I know what Im doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change How do I stop this behavior and thought process"	httpscounselchatcomquestionshowdoibreakanunhealthyrelationshippattern	Relationship Dissolution 	Kristi KingMorgan LMSW	httpscounselchatcomtherapistskristikingmorganlmsw	It is a good thing that you have recognized that you have been in some unhealthy relationships and that you are wanting to break this pattern  You seem to have some good insight into the situationThe type of behavior that you are describing is usually rooted in childhood issues with insecure attachment bonds with your caregivers childhood trauma andor abuse or neglect or dysfunctional family issues that did not allow you to develop healthy boundaries for yourself or a sense of self  This is something that is going to take some time to work through in therapy  I recommend a book titled Boundaries Where you end and I begin by Anne Katherine  Another book that might be helpful is Codependent No More by Melody BeattieIn the meantime until you can work through your personal issues absolutely do not enter into another relationship  Take however long you need to and work on becoming a whole happy emotionally healthy person on your own  Needing another person to define you is problematic  Thats too much to expect from any individualFor a relationship to be healthy and happy both people in the relationship first need to be a whole person on their own  That means having a clear sense of self knowing who you are and what you want knowing how to set healthy boundaries and knowing how to meet your own needs  It is unreasonable to expect your partner to meet all of your needs all of the time  There will be times that they wont be able to meet your needs  You have to know how to meet those yourselfWhen you are working on becoming the best you that you can be eventually the right person will come into your life  Then you can CHOOSE to be with someone because you want them in your life instead of feeling like you NEED them to complete you	0
556bec8cc969ba5861709df3	I have anger issues I am extremely explosive about the simplest things	I easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions for managing my anger	httpscounselchatcomquestionsihaveangerissuesiamextremelyexplosiveaboutthesimplestthings	Anger Management	Kristi KingMorgan LMSW	httpscounselchatcomtherapistskristikingmorganlmsw	I suggest that you work on emotional awarenessEmotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and whyEmotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions In other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you doOften feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelingsBeing emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others  Being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstoodMany people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions  For example men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness  Therefore many men learned to turn feelings of sadness insecurities or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger  Being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear  Instead it makes us learn how to express it in other incorrect ways  If a man never learns to say I am sad or that really hurt my feelings and instead lashes out in anger then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstoodYou can control yourself and not explode  Walk away remove yourself from the situation do whatever you have to do to not lash out  Instead of reacting the way you normally would go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a simple thing upset you  What is the real feeling driving these outbursts  Maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying patternIt might help to keep an anger journal  Write down everything that gets you upset  That might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off  Talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience	0
5566f9a2a64752d71ec3ca67	Ive suffered from insomnia and nightmares for about 3 years	"It takes me a long time to fall asleep Id estimate about two hours I often have nightmares starting with being eaten by a monster and I often wake up frightened and unable to breathe

I believe I started losing sleep after breaking up with a girlfriend of 8 years Also my fathers business went bankrupt and my mother has a chronic condition I was under a lot of stress and life lost meaning

After improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress my symptoms improved However in the past couple months I started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning How can I solve this issue"	httpscounselchatcomquestionsivesufferedfrominsomniaandnightmaresforabout3years	Sleep Improvement	Danielle Alvarez	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsdaniellealvarez	First of all exercise is always beneficial for your physical and emotional health Thats great that you have added this in your routine Have you also considered altering your diet Certain foods are linked with poor sleep For example alcohol caffeine nicotine and high fat content foods do not bode well with quality sleep especially right before bed timeOn the other hand warm milk and foods high in carbohydrates have actually shown to positively impact sleepAdditionally at bed time its important to keep your room dim cool and without distractions ie TV IPad Phone Stick to a sleep routine and avoid any activities close to bed time that demand a lot of attention and energyAs far as your nightmares there could be many causes contributing to them Certain foods many of the ones mentioned or medications could be the culprit Doing a bit of research into the ones you are consuming may help you eliminate the offenderYou may also benefit from talk therapy with a qualified therapist to discuss any underlying issues you are experiencing Oftentimes depression and anxiety can manifest themselves during sleep causing nightmaresFinally Yoga has shown to be very beneficial for quality sleep There are many instructional videos available that can introduce you to the practice if youd rather not join a class right awayBest of luck to you and I sincerely hope you are able to catch up on some well deserved Zs	0
5570b7fea03de6c365f45ba1	Unethical Therapy Practices	What do you do when a therapist and a parent drugs a child and makes up lies in order to stop the other parents custody visitation	httpscounselchatcomquestionsunethicaltherapypractices	Professional EthicsLegal  Regulatory	Kristi KingMorgan LMSW	httpscounselchatcomtherapistskristikingmorganlmsw	I will admit I am confused about this question  Are you the other parent in question or a concerned coworker of this therapistTherapists do not prescribe or have access to medication  Most therapists wont even get involved in a custody battle  They know there is a good chance of their records ending up in court and that they themselves will have to testify in court  Of course therapists are human and can make mistakes but I find it highly unlikely that a therapist would knowingly and willingly do something like this that is such a major ethical violation  Not only are they losing their license to practice by doing this they are going to face criminal charges and jail time  If their clinical judgment is that the other parent is a danger to the child they dont have to resort to illegal means to try to prove thisIf you have concrete proof that this has happened then there is a process in which you can file a report against the therapist with their licensure board  Every therapist is licensed in their state  There are different types of licensures so you would need to know this therapists licensureMost accusations from the other parent are expected in a custody situation because people do tend to get quite ugly  Dont accuse the therapist or the parent of anything just to try to make yourself look better and them look bad  Have evidence of wrongdoing before accusing them of this  If this has really happened then of course it needs to be reported but dont try to ruin someones career unless you are sure this occurred	0

55723d8aa03de6c365f45c31	My girlfriend broke up with me but I want her back  What do I do	"Me and my girlfriend just broke up She said she loves me but is not in love anymore This came out of nowhere We seemed so happy together
It all started when she went to Missouri to visit her family The first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sisters house everything changed Thats when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore I thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again
Then she told me to come to her in Missouri So thats what I did I quit my job I dropped everything said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her
Once I got there everything was fine again She apologized for everything and said she didnt mean any of it then we were good for about a week Then she went back to saying she didnt love me anymore and had no feelings for me
The only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this is that now she is pregnant This wasnt an accident We were trying to get pregnant so all this is hard to accept I love her so much I have never been bad to her Ive treated her the best I can I wanted her to be my wife I was going to propose to her when she got back Now Im losing my family and my mind I dont know what to do"	httpscounselchatcomquestionsmygirlfriendbrokeupwithmebutiwantherbackwhatdoido	Relationships	Kristi KingMorgan LMSW	httpscounselchatcomtherapistskristikingmorganlmsw	I am sorry to hear of these troubles  I see a few issues here  I wonder why you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled  Some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant and all this does is bring up more problemsYou say you never treated her badly and I believe you  People in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on  In fact giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a self outside of this relationship can be unhealthy  It takes two whole healthy happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole healthy happy couple in a relationship  Expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to workThere are two books that I recommend you buy and read  One is Codependent No More  The other is Can My Relationship Be SavedSometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone it makes you both miserable  You cannot change her and cannot change her mind  Sometimes the best thing is to let go  If it is meant to be you will end up back together again  It seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving  I suggest backing off and letting her go  Maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind  If it is meant to be she will come back If not use this time to work on being a healthy happy you on your own	0

Ive fought depression and won however stress and anxiety are killing me I feel that my friends dont listen to me I know they have their own problems which I do my best to help with But they dont always try to help me with mine when I really need them I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust"	httpscounselchatcomquestionshowcanigetpeopletolisten	AnxietyFamily ConflictDepressionStressSocial Relationships	Keisha Helms	httpscounselchatcomtherapistskeishahelms	Hi there Being 15 years old can be a very difficult time in your teenage life I remember when I was 15 and how I often felt my parents werent listening to me Its even more difficult when you feel that you do not have a friend that you can confide inHaving depression in the past and being able to get through it shows me that you can get through anything Depression alone is a very difficult problem to work through In addition to the communication problem with your parents it appears that you are also struggling with stress and anxiety We all have stress and anxiety in our lives If we didnt none of us would be living Anxiety  stress keep us on our toes Often I have to remind myself of this as well However it is how we manage stress and anxiety so it will not overcome our livesAre you familiar with relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises meditation or yoga Relaxation Techniques can help you tremendously in reducing your stress and anxietyDeep breathing exercises are helpful when you are on the go such as school shopping out with friends or whatever extracurricular activities you engage in  Most people do not take full advantage of their lung capacity I know that sounds silly But its true You would be surprised how much air you lungs can hold Imagine being in the Doctors office and taking deep breaths This is what you want to do when you are feeling overwhelmed andor stressed Take a moment to take in at least 10 deep breaths and let them out slowly You will be surprised how well you feel afterwardsMeditation and Yoga are also healthy forms to working through stress and anxiety You will need a quiet place for your meditation You want to be in the moment and take in the peace and serenity All it takes is a quiet place closing your eyes and thinking of your happy place Some people use meditation music as well If you have access to this type of music and or the internet for more ways to practice meditation please go for itYoga on the other hand will take a little more work and practice I would not suggest you learning this on your own if you have never attempted yoga before Find an experienced Yoga instructor to teach you the ropes andor ask your school counselor about the possibility of getting someone to come to the school to teach the studentsLastly in regards to your parents it is very important to be able to have a relationship where you feel comfortable communicating I would recommend writing a letter to them if you are unable to express how you feel in person A letter is more intimate and requires a little more effort on their end If they are open on working on this relationship maybe suggest family counseling to fully work on this issueI hope this was helpful for you and I wish you the best	0

Soon after I experienced a miscarriage I texted him about what had happened and he didnt seem to care I was extremely hurt by this I still decided to move back as I had originally planned He helped me with the move and replaced the money I had lent him During this time I asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because I needed to know Although he says he did I hardly ever see him He never got a job which was in the original plan  

After that we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together Once we got back together I cut all ties with the former relationship I had been in I thought he had too But I found out that he did not attempt to do as I did and was still talking with another woman In fact he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her When I confronted him about this he wasnt apologetic He said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone He even closed his car window on my finger and tried to throw me out of his car I dont know what to do"	httpscounselchatcomquestionswhenshouldigiveuponarelationship	RelationshipsDomestic Violence	Danielle Alvarez	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsdaniellealvarez	There are plenty of red flags that you have been presented withSeveral breakupsNot holding up his end of the bargain regarding workLack of empathy for your miscarriageLying about his involvement with another womanPhysical violence which is of most concernThis seems to be a very unhealthy relationship In my experience relationships such as these rarely become positive ones Violence is never okay and regardless of his reasoning you looking through his phone it is indefensible You have to look at these red flags and ask yourself Is this really someone I want to marry Is he an asset to my life I think youll realize he is notBest of luck to you and please know that you deserve someone who treats you with kindness dignity and respect	0

5579e690a9732755160c6a88	How can I let go of my dream wedding	"I have been with my husband for almost 7 years We got engaged a little after 5 years of being together I had always been clear that I wanted to get married and I sadly would drop hints about how i wanted him to propose 
When he did propose it was during a random vacation that I had planned I was happy but I couldnt help feeling disappointed too
I had told him numerous times before that I wanted him to do it in front of my friends and family I know it sounds dumb to be upset but I couldnt help how I was feeling
We are now married but the wedding and ring were also far from what I wanted and it wasnt due to lack of funds  I know this is all material and the marriage is the most important thing but I cant help but get jealous and envious every time I see someone get a proposal or wedding that I had wanted
I cant help my anger because I know we only get one proposal and one wedding What I wanted will never happen
I have been working on my feelings for the past year and half to get over it I try to focus on our marriage but every time I see someone have the best proposals and weddings I get upset
I know it is selfish and I know its petty but I just cant control it Its ruining our relationship because I constantly think about it Plus I get mad at him for small things because I am trying to hide the fact that I am so disappointed 
Why cant I move on"	httpscounselchatcomquestionshowcaniletgoofmydreamwedding	Marriage	Danielle Alvarez	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsdaniellealvarez	Its hard to let go of the dreams you had regarding your wedding and engagement This was something that you and most women think about for years so its understandable to be disappointed But please be aware that it is rare that any wedding is perfect You may envy your friends weddings but more than likely they had a few mishaps of their own andor it wasnt as perfect as they had planned it eitherHowever like you know the marriage is the most important thing  How many women are envious that you are in a happy stable relationship I assure you that there are plentyTry to live in the present considering that dwelling on the past can still not change how you were proposed to or how your wedding day transpired Focus on what you can control NOW Perhaps you can plan an extravagant renewal of your vows or change the look of your ringI would also be upfront with your husband and explain why youve been short lately But after that close that chapter and move on It sounds like you have a wonderful companion and you certainly dont want to lose this due to a situation that is impossible to change	0

Thats adifficult questionto answerDreaming is a normal and healthy part of the sleep cycle The current thought is that we all generally
experience roughly the same number of dreams  the difference often is just
whether we remember the dreams or notAn increase in the number or frequency of distressing dreams
or nightmares can be a symptom of stress anxiety or PTSD If the dreams are disturbing to you talking to a local
counselor could helpIf the dreams themselves
are not troubling you may just be remembering them more than most people do"	0

always been and will always be that way But I also do this when things are
going well That is I forget how good things can turn bad Personally to
avoid this emotional rollercoaster I try and heed the famous advice by author
and feminist Rita Mae Brown One of the keys to happiness is a bad
memorySo maybe this weakness of your for forgetting is really a
strength It sounds a lot like living in the moment to me And while its hard
to manage my past and my future the moment seems like a small enough piece of
temporal real estate to sort out So thats the what of my answer The how
goes like this Choose one from column A two from column B and three from
column C in the following chart Then try doing them for as long as you can
Then see what happensA B CGratitude Forgiveness AppreciationExpectations Meditation ExerciseBitterness Distraction Volunteering
Resentment Substances WorryRegret Possessions PessimismShame Desire SuperstitionRage Isolation WishingSelfloathing Criticism WithholdingIf you feel as though what you
think and believe are out of your control or that your values were imposed on
you or that nothing good will ever happen again then we will have to
respectfully disagree Youve ask a very deep and insightful question proving
that your hope has gotten you this far Hang onto that hope because Im an
example of things working out despite my previous way of looking at my lifeInstead of convincing
yourself that youre okay when youre not how about calling it accepting
yourself as okay just the way you are without judging your okayness You
probably have high standards perfectionism and thats a thing to talk with a
counselor about The opposite of perfect is not horrible Its called good
enoughBlocking out the bad things and
forgetting is as natural as eating and sleeping All the other mammals do it
except when it comes to lifethreatening bad things so why shouldnt we This
might be called optimism
Feeling alone and uncared for
is a worse feeling than being despised This is good This means I suppose
that you dont despise yourself as much as you just dont care for you because
we can often project our own selfbeliefs onto others This is an abstract
concept that will take some time to get used to But I have a suspicion that
with just a little more selfcare and a little more caring for others you
might be better off very soon"	0

The point is there is so much drama I try my best to get along with everyone I dont understand where I went wrong besides replying back to his question I feel like Im going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyones frustrations are taken out on each other and its the children that are hurting I had a party planned for my daughters birthday and my exboyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldnt let me have her In my eyes its the child that is hurting I was throwing a party for her birthday and because of the problem with stupid pickup details about my stepdaughter which I have no control over he took it out on our daughter"	httpscounselchatcomquestionsmyexboyfriendwouldntletmehavemydaughterbecauseididntknowmystepdaughterspickupdetails	Family ConflictRelationshipsMarriage	Lynda Martens	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsmslyndamartenslondonontario	Hi I appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation I agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the childrenChildren need adults around them to act maturely cooperatively and peacefully even when they dont like each other it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing Your exboyfriendseems more focused on his own needs In fact he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive controlling and manipulative bordering on parental alienation I agree this is a problemI also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy Its not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress Honour this instinct you haveI will suggest a few things to you First to gather support around you professionally if you need it from family and friends and certainly from your husband If you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex that will help He can help run interference when it comes to his daughter It will help you feel supportedKnow that your exs behaviours arent happening because you did anything wrong its the way he operates and maybe this is why youre not with him You cant change him but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression Youre correct that he will always be there and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situationKeep on defining clear boundaries You might sound like a broken record Youll have to talk to my husband about that but thats okay Its okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle Its okay to not respond to texts or other communications that arent vitally important Its okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable Its okay to not engage with him more than is necessaryRegarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you I recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully Let him know what your expectations are simply and clearly and in writing our agreement states X and you are not following our agreement Your daughter doesnt have to be aware I think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflictA professional therapist can help you with all of this I hope this helps get you started towards greater peace at least within yourself 	0

I dont know what to do I need some closure or Im not going to be able to move on from this I dont know what it is but its driving me crazy Im so happy with my current boyfriend and I know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling Hes such a good person I also know my exboyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things but I cant get it out of my head Im trying to take a nap right now between classes but I cant sleep because my mind is racing Ive never been so hung up on something for this long ever

I want to just talk it out with my exboyfriend but I dont know if thats a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face If he told his girlfriend everything could go wrong because she hates me If my current boyfriend knew he would be crushed On one hand I want my exboyfriend to say no to having feelings for me but I would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too Where would I go from there On the other hand I feel like I cant move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this Sometimes I wish I could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex but I dont want to

After improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress my symptoms improved However in the past couple months I started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning How can I solve this issue"	httpscounselchatcomquestionsivesufferedfrominsomniaandnightmaresforabout3years	Sleep Improvement	Ben Braaksma	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsbenbraaksma	"
Youre noticing that as you lie down to go to sleep there
is quite a bit going on which may be anxiety related It sounds like the
dreams and difficulty sleeping are reminiscent of previous experiences you had
around the time of your break up the difficulty with your fathers business
and your mothers health issues These connections to past events may be
important insights to continue exploring in addition to finding out more about
what your dreams may be trying to tell you There is no exact science to
dreams but many people find it fruitful to explore the content as it relates to
significant themes in their lives I think that exploring these issues further with
a therapist could help you resolve whatever is causing you the stress trouble sleeping and frightening dreams

A few days later she tells me how much shes missing me and lets get together for lunch or something like that Then about two weeks later we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other in love not just sex but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her So for her childs sake she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen She had told me all about him previously and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child Our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged but she is torn and confused She doesnt even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly I know she needs time and all I can do is take care of myself We have agreed to remain friends and if this doesnt work out for her we will try again Im completely in love with her and Im in extreme pain"	httpscounselchatcomquestionstheloveofmylifewantstotrygettingbacktogetherwithherchildsfather	Relationships	Sherry Katz LCSW	httpscounselchatcomtherapistssherrykatzlcsw	Love doesnt hurtYour description of the relationship so far is that you are feeling a lot of emotional pain alongside a deep attraction for this womanIn some relationships the benefit of what draws us together with someone is being able to learn more about our own deep sense of who we are what we value and care aboutThis sounds more descriptive of your relationship than that it is a loving one Your descriptions are of the womans life parenting and relationship dilemmas not about how much of an effort she is willing to make in her life so that the two of you are able to be together for the long termTry distinguishing your wishes to be loved by this woman with what actually is taking place in everyday lifeBeing aware of how much love youd like to give and receive is valuable selfknowledgeYour ongoing emotional wear and tear of all decisions about the relationship that affect you being the result of the womans choices sounds like the opposite of loveThe relationship is very useful as an access in selfunderstanding of your needs and wishes It sounds like this is its main value in your life not that it is sustainable in realityGood luck	0

5686e9c1e716b51523007b24	Do I leave my cheating husband or share him with someone	"Ive been with my husband for eight years now We have split twice before and the first time was because he cheated I took him back months later and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes However we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust My insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse which lead to us separating again During that separation he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with But we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until I got pregnant with our second child

The baby was a few months old and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her He told me how he could never stop talking to her and how during our issues she has been and is the only women hes gone behind my back with but on a friendship level because shes miles away He confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like hes possibly in love with her too He said he feels like hes in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him and she hasnt been able to leave him alone since Even though she knows that hes still with me and happy with our family she cant help it and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual Being that he loves me too he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time He wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels but he didnt want me to find out so he told me everything He said he didnt want to continue to lie to me and so I can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when its only been this one girl the whole time He feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her and that no matter what he did to do right I would still accuse him Hes caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesnt want me to leave him because Im the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life

Im of course hurt and in shock I feel like I have to make a decision on whether I want to allow it and deal with having to share him or walk away Both of these decisions are really hard to make because I feel like whether I stay or go my heart will still be torn apart I have to make a decision quick because she will be flying out sooner than I thought"	httpscounselchatcomquestionsdoileavemycheatinghusbandorsharehimwithsomeone	MarriageIntimacy	Lynda Martens	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsmslyndamartenslondonontario	Hi Jayuya Im struggling in this moment with my own biases I have biases that are about respect and every individuals need for and right to respect Your husband lies cheats and physically hurts you He makes excuses and blames you for these behaviours and trains you to do the same He demonstrates many controlling and abusive behaviours And now in an attempt to manipulate and silence you he wants to have his cake and eat it too and suggests you should share him There arent many crumbs of this cake left for you are thereSo my biases about respect dont make me want to rescue you or tell you what to do I cant do that and I dont think either of those things will help you Id like to ask you some questions thoughAre you happy Do you know what happy is Do you know what respect is Are your children safe Are your children witnessing violence because if they are then theyre not safe Do you have supports Do your family and friends know whats happening in your life Have you ever been to a womens shelter Are you willing to sit down in an office with a professional who can help you think clearly Thats what I suggest These are big decisions you deserve some support I wish you the best	0

Lately Tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when Sally leaves for college at the end of term this year Hes been asking me to help him with Sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her But hes also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they wont have to deal with it when she leaves He seems really torn up about it and I want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves

5691ee8133a2cb5364e7b51d	Is it possible to gain joy and prosperity in my relationship after years of unhappiness	My boyfriend and I have been together for five years now Throughout the entire first day that we met he and I had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another That same night he and a friend stayed over at my house without my moms acknowledgment and we kissed The next two days were a repetition of the first day On the third night my mother finally caught us and I was kicked out of my house I left with him of course and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple It was very hard for us His stepdad also kicked him out of his home and we were staying at cheap hotels and friends houses with the little money we had I quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home There were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a Walmart parking lot Our honeymoon stage as they call it probably only lasted one month After that it was a downward spiral We were constantly arguing about money food and our families We kept having the famous youre doing it wrongdo it this way argument After six months we moved across the country only to live the same thing and thats when the violence started One afternoon after a serious argument he got into his truck and threatened to leave me I was frightened that he would actually go through with his word given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one He told me to let him leave or he would hit me He had once promised he would never touch me so I challenged him to do it He slapped me and ever since that time when we have serious fights he loses control and hurts me I havent had the courage to leave him and theres really nothing stopping me now I dont live with him I dont depend on him and we dont have children We both havent been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly He always apologizes and at the beginning he was more willing to change Now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how I dont ever make the effort to try to be okay Ive read enough about domestic violence to know that its not my fault that he loses control so thats not even an issue for me I know he has to change that on his own I just want to know if theres people who have gone through this and had the tables turned Is there hope for a better future together	httpscounselchatcomquestionsisitpossibletogainjoyandprosperityinmyrelationshipafteryearsofunhappiness	RelationshipsDomestic Violence	Lynda Martens	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsmslyndamartenslondonontario	Hi Winters I learned a long time ago that I cant ever predict who will change and who wont I meet couples who seem to have all the ingredients but cant make it work and others who have severe issues and they decide to make better decisions and things change But in reading your story the image of a slot machine came to mind Youre gambling your life away on the chance that this guy will change Only you can decide how many years to give it I see him giving you clear signs that he doesnt even believe in himself or want to change though What are you waiting forAlthough you say you know his behaviours arent your fault something tells me that youre hoping your love for him will turn the key that unlocks something and makes him want to change It doesnt work that way Just like the slot machine you have no power to change him or make this work You can only decide when youve paid too muchI bet theres someone out there who loves and misses you Hes not your only support	0

Taking accountability for your actions and seeking help is an excellent first step I wonder where the anger is coming from Learning what is at
the root of it can shed some light on what the problem is and can provide some
relief in itself I would also suggest doing some selfexploration and see a
therapist for individual sessions in order to gain a clearer insight as to what
the cause is There are also several actions you can take on your own to help
control your anger and communicate more effectivelyHere is what I would recommend
you try
Take time outs When you feel yourself becoming upset excuse yourself and
take a time out to either think about the most appropriate course of
actionor redirect your thoughts all together Often when webecome
angry it is difficult to see the issue clearly as our emotionsget in
the way
Do deep breathing exercises Close your eyes Breathe in slowly to the
count of 4 Breathe out even slower to the count of 6 Practice this for about
5 minutes 3 times a day and focus on nothing except your breathing during this
time Once it becomes routine for you it will be easier to apply during
situations in which you are angry or upset
Change negative thought patterns Try and recall or be aware of your
thoughts particularly when you are feeling angry What are these thoughts
telling you Are they valid or logical Is there factual evidence to support
the negative thoughts Often the answer is no Learn to stop the
negative thoughts and replace them with logical andmore positive
ones
Communicate effectively As a speaker you want to use I
statements by telling the other person how you feel instead of blaming himher
by using you statements For example you might say something such
as I feel sad when you dont come home at a decent hour and I dont get
to spend time with you versus You always stay out late and dont
even care about me The speaker should also avoid using black and white
language such as always never etc As the listener you want to validate what
you hear so that the other person knows that you are listening You will also want
to be responsive and offer fair solutions
I wish you luck in using these tools and learning about where your anger comes
from

Im not sure if Im overreacting or not I just feel like Im so honest with him about everything and I expect the same honesty He is a good husband in every other regard"	httpscounselchatcomquestionsmyhusbandwaslyingaboutdrinkingagain	AddictionMarriageIntimacy	Lynda Martens	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsmslyndamartenslondonontario	Hi Los AngelesSo your husband is giving you mixed messages He says hes willing to cut back on the drinking but he drinks and hides it His behaviour is passive aggressive and immature which puts you into this position of having to act like a disapproving parent It sounds more like youre talking about an outofcontrol teenager than your partnerYour husbands lying is sending a message I get to make my own decisions and you cant stop me might be it Underneath that maybe its I want to stop but Im ashamed that I cant and I dont want you to see my failures Ultimately as an adult he gets to decide what he puts in his mouth and if you try to manage that by monitoring how many beers he has you are pretty certain to get some fallout pushbackbacklash How does his drinking affect you Thats where your voice has power rather than in counting his beers or setting him up to lie when hes passed out asking if hes been drinking seems confusing Youve mentioned snoring which I guess is a legitimate complaint If hes passing out thats a legitimate complaint When he drinks does he drive act aggressively or check out of the relationship avoid you All of these things are legitimate concerns and Id stick to talking about those rather than counting beers My guess is he has few other ways to cope with stress so he checks out with alcohol and it also helps him avoid your relationship But the problem is it makes it worse the more he avoids you then more you chase him with your questionsTheres a conversation that would be helpful here It sounds like Ive tried to support you in your drinking less and its not working What are your goals for alcohol and how can I support you in that more effectively Id like to see you in a place where youre not micromanaging his drinking but focusing on the things that affect you What concrete supportive methods can you use with his agreement Can we get the alcohol out of the house Is he willing to seek treatmentLay your expectations out really clearly I wont count your beers but I cant tolerate lying You have to decide whats more important is it really the number of beers or is it something else What do you need to happen in order to want to remain in the marriage What does he need Does he let you know what isnt okay with him He might have trouble saying these thingsThe drinking is only a part of the complex dynamic in your marriage A qualified therapist can assist in pulling this apart understanding it and changing the way you relate to each other	0

two demons start out as pesky and little when we are young then grow with us to
become quite formidable Id like to throw in a technique I learned from Randy
Rausch author ofThe Last Lecturecalled The 3Step Apology
I teach this important bit of wisdom to my clients when they need to apologize
to someone else but more importantly when they need to forgive themselvesYes when we have trouble forgiving ourselves we sometimes forget
that there is part of us that just doesnt know how to apologize effectively
Here goesStep One Say what you did and the damage it causedStep Two Say youre sorry and accept full
responsibility no excuses no explanation no defensiveness It was all my
faultStep
Three Ask what you can do to repair the damageStep Three is the one many of us didnt learn growing up And when
we add it to an apology we are usually surprised that the penalty is as light
as it is Of course sometimes the apology is not accepted and no way to atone
is offered So be it we cant control this But if we are apologizing to
ourselves we can There is always a way to make amends if we put our heart
into it
Give this a try the next time youre reluctant to let yourself off
the hook You might surprise yourself when how benevolent you can be when
invited"	0

to and most of us have to work at itcertainly at first Im here to tell you
that living in the now or being mindful is a skill anyone can learn Unfortunately
the only way to do it is to do it What a paradox But there are plenty of
other skills that we are not born with walking on stilts riding a bike
swimming and driving a car are good examples You cant learn them by reading about
themHaving said that I can recommend two books on
the subject Eckhart Tolles The Power of
Now and David Richos When the Past
is Present Richo asks that we dont beat ourselves up about dwelling on
past events This is natures way of reminding us that we have unfinished
business But while we are attended to the wounds and confusion that litter our earlier lives we can prepare to inhabit the expanded present that awaits usHe offers three helpful steps to making any important life
changeStep One Hold in awareness the behavior
belief attitude or characteristic you want to change in yourself and how you
want to be different Awareness is the opposite of distraction and stuffingStep Two Live as if you have
already made the change This is hard and takes courage but you can do it
Ride that bikeeven if for a foot or twoStep Three Be persistent
Practice practice practiceJust as twoyearolds are able to walk
confidently after hundreds of hours of practice youll be able to stay in the
here and now as long as you want after trying and failing many many times

Am I crazy I dont think these thoughts are normal"	httpscounselchatcomquestionsthoughtsofafterlifecausesanxiety	AnxietySpirituality	Lynda Martens	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsmslyndamartenslondonontario	Hi California What youre experiencing is indeed anxiety its very common Through research we know a lot of things about how to reduce anxiety Ill get you started and its a great idea to connect with a therapist who can build on these ideas and get to know you wellIts natural to have random thoughts that unsettle us Our brains are complex wonderful things Fearful and anxious thoughts are a part of this picture their purpose is to prepare us for the future and to help us make sense of the past and learn from it But what happens sometimes is that our alarm systems get out of whack and get set off too easily We often spend TOO MUCH time worrying about things that happened or might happen When these thoughts take away from our enjoyment of life it becomes a problem So while fear and anxiety try to protect us they also seek power and will take any power they can getIn general fear and anxiety try to tell us one or both of two things that something is wrong with us or that something bad will happen or that something bad will happen because theres something wrong with us They will use anything they can as evidence to convince you For example That person looked at you funny Youre strange looking Well there are dozens of possible explanations for the look on that persons face and its unlikely it had anything to do with youFor you personally your thoughts are about the afterlifeabout living forever What does fear tell you will be uncomfortable about living forever What would the worst part be A therapist would help you dig deep to find the core of what you fear It might be that you have no control over who you are or where you go It might be that you fear going to hell because youre bad Search for that deepest fearI invite you then to picture that thought as a glass of water on a shelf Its a heavy glass and if you held it in your hands for a while and stared at it it would get in the way youd be uncomfortable and unable to focus on your life Thats whats happening now I suggest that the problem is not so much the thought youre having we all have random silly thoughts that usually arent true The problem is how long youre holding it in your hand You could have that thought pick up that glass a hundred times a day and as long as you put it right back on the shelf its not a problem The trick is to get it back on that shelfRight now youre using distraction to do this Youre trying to focus on other things around you but I think the glass is still in your hand Its not enough youre looking for more tools to get that glass back on the shelf And the key is in your thoughts Once you find out what fear is trying to tell you then you can talk back to fear So as an example if fear is saying to you you have no control over anything then you can work to accept the pieces you dont have control over learn to tolerate that feeling and claim back the pieces you CAN control You CAN control the extent to which you let fear take you overWith a therapist you can learn to refute fears ideas You can learn to look for concrete evidence of fears lies and gain back control over your thoughts I wish you the best	0

56ef4246a2549bd957c94ace	Why do my boyfriend and I have such trouble communicating	Weve been together almost three years We argue and he ends it by telling me he doesnt love me Its hurtful because I am all about resolving the problem and he dwells on the issue even if I drop what hes done and just swallow my pride and say I am sorry How can this be resolved We have kids and I dont want a broken family because we cant communicate	httpscounselchatcomquestionswhydomyboyfriendandihavesuchtroublecommunicating	Relationships	Sherry Katz LCSW	httpscounselchatcomtherapistssherrykatzlcsw	Try having a conversation with your boyfriend about your views and wishes for the relationship when the two of you are having a calm time A few questions Id like to ask him is why he says he doesnt love you when the topic at hand is about a specific practical matterId also like to know what he hopes will happen from dwelling on a matterAnd why are you swallowing your pride Sooner or later this will come up on you in much bigger ways Instead try to know your own wishes that you are either not stating or are being ignored by your boyfriendThe best way to resolve accumulated tensions is to slowly open the discussion between the two peopleIt is possible to stay together forever What you each need to realize is the terms under which this would most likely take placeSending lots of luck	0
55dc21c49b8c19d146fcd297	I am 18 years old with a baby on the way	"Me and the father of my child have been dating for a year We had a big argument and at first he wanted to work it out But with time he started asking others and they told him to leave me
Now he wants me to wait on him to mature He wants to talk to other people Then come back in four years He doesnt want to deal with me while Im pregnant He doesnt take me to the doctor or anything I feel alone  How do I handle this situation"	httpscounselchatcomquestionsiam18yearsoldwithababyontheway	Relationships	Sonya Wilson	httpscounselchatcomtherapistssonyawilson	Well as far as your boyfriend sounds like he has received advice from others that is not wise advice Leaving is not the answer after a big argument as you mentioned However this is not surprising to me based on his possible age and maturity level Having a baby is a lifetime responsibility and there are very few who handle this or who realizes that it requires one to step their game up This is something that he has to realize and be encouraged by his parents or a mature adult to do Hopefully someone who has better wise advice will talk to him and he will listenAs for you how do you handle this situation is your questionyou do what you have to do to prepare for your baby with or without him A lot can happen in four years and you dont have time are not required and cant wait to see what will happen with him You have a LIFE to prepare for to feed to protect and to love Can you tell your baby to wait I dont want to deal with you now I need to mature I will be back to see you later Hope you will be fine Nope  As I always say you are not alone because there is someone somewhere going through the same or similar thing Develop healthy friendshipswhether with family friends or new people who may enter your life Your support system will grow and life will go onwith or with him Stay focus on you and your baby 	0

which is hard wired into the human nervous system specifically theautonomic nervous system called the autonomic response This system
is responsible for regulating the heart digestion respiratory rate
as well as other aspects which match the symptoms you describe It is largely an unconscious function but
with training it can be managed such as a public speaking course in which you
prepare and even have some exposure to smaller experiences to help you prepare
and cope for larger presentations One of the greatest applications of
addressing this response is the NASA program which exposes the astronauts to situations
they will encounter while in space which will trigger the response so that when
it does happen not if but when that they are able to move through the
challenge with success You can learn
more about his by going to TED Talks What I learned about going blind in space It is
a truly inspiring look at what you are experiencing as well as how to deal with
it 
With that being said finding a program
like a Dale Carnegie Public Speaking program can help Working with a counselor who can help you

always talk to your doctor to see what options might be available there as

Hello Thank you for your question There are few things
that people find more personal than their sexual relationships When we feel
connected to our partner sex can be best thing since sliced bread However if
we feel disconnected in some way sex can feel degrading and even painful 
I dont know the specifics about your relationship or how
comfortable you are in talking to your boyfriend but this is one of those
situations where communicating your fears is a good idea The only exception to
that would be if you believe he is actually a threat to you in some way If you
believe that then you should do whatever you think is safe It sounds like
there is a part of you that is already afraid of him and if that is the case
then remaining safe is your top priority 
Assuming you are able to share with him your feelings
telling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate
and sexually healthy Sex is something that is supposed to be enjoyable for
all parties All parties should feel respected and able to say no to
absolutely anything they are not comfortable with 
I call the respectful agreement between sexual partners sex
trust Sex Trust means your partner respects your boundaries It means they
wont degrade you sexually with hurtful words forced sex or forcing or
coercing sex in ways someone is not interested in having Your personal safety and mental wellbeing is
what is most important 
Now if there is a part of you that is curious about BDSM
and may be interested in participating in it there are many websites that you
can explore to learn information I will warn you some websites and articles
are better or worse than others but you may at least feel more informed 
Many people engage in BDSM and have happy relationships but
again it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants It is
also important to know that BDSM is notjust one thing and people practice it
differently based on comfort If it is something you are uncomfortable with

Hello and thank you for your question The question about
whether or not to cheat is based on personal values that can only be answered
by you However here are a few things to consider and questions to ask
yourself to help you find your answer
1
Do you feel like you are violating your own
values or morals This is important because we all have different values and
morals surrounding sex love and monogamy If you value monogamous
relationships and find yourself cheating on your partner then you may feel
like you are living in contradiction to your values and most people are not
happy when they do that However if monogamy is not something you value then
perhaps it is time to reevaluate the relationship and determine if it is still
right for you Not all people want monogamous relationships and that
is alright Finallyif you value your husbands feelings and know that the
affairs would hurt him then your behaviors may again be in contrast to your
own values That can only be determined by you 
2Based on how you describe your relationship it
sounds like you are not very satisfied with the way it is From the outside it looks like the affairs
are a way to get even with your husband or to feel better after an argument This
is something that can happen when mutual respect starts to fade in a
relationship and gets replaced with contempt We can simply stop caring about
how our actions hurt each other or potentially hurt each other Perhaps the
question to ask here is when you look out toward the future with your husband
is this the pattern that you want to keep The pattern of very little sex
argument and then satisfying the pain or dissatisfaction with affairs 
3What are your goals for this relationship If we
start to become disconnected in a relationship we can begin to do things on
autopilot Get up get the kids up go to work come home and go to bed None
of which requires any intimacy at all Are you still able to see the hopes and
dreams you once had for this relationship
4
Have you considered seeking marital counseling Not
having affairs wont actually fix the part of the relationship that is leading
you to have them If there is something broken it sometimes requires some help
to get it fixed 
Hopefully these questions and thoughts will help you come to
some kind of conclusion about what is right for you and your relationship I certainly
wish you well

Hello and thank you for your question Loving someone who
doesnt respect or treat you well can be enormously difficult and painful 
Many people who find themselves in an emotionally hurtful
relationship say that it was wonderful when it first started but that over
time their partners behaviors changed and they became emotionally or
physically abusive 
I want to say right away that it is not your fault in any
way if someone is abusive to you It does not mean that you are broken or that there
is something wrong with your character if you have not left the situation
People stay for many reasons such as fear finances children pressure from
others and love 
Many people have had to leave their abusive partners who
they still love to preserve their own safety and regain the sense of self they
may have lost It is a very difficult thing to do even if you know it is the
right thing 
The person who really needs to take a hard look at
themselves is the person doing the abusing
It is very common for mental and emotional abuse to wear
away at someones selfesteem This can lead to other problems like depression
and anxiety These issues sometimes require professional support to manage
such as a counselor or perhaps a doctor who may prescribe medication 
A counselor may be able to help you sort through your fears
and concerns about staying or leaving To look at things from different angles
and to help you decide what is best for you 
You have not said that your husband has been physically abusive
to you but if that has been the case then you must consider your physical
safety first Leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous time
Getting help from professionals would be critical and I would recommend your
local domestic violence program 
Whatever you decide to do is the right thing for you I
would encourage you to ask yourself honestly about your reasons for staying and
the barriers that may keep you from going You do deserve to be happy and
emotionally safe If you do not feel like you have that safety then seeking
someone to help you sort through these things is a good plan 
I wish you well

Hello and thank you for your question Being bisexual can be particularly
difficult because it is often misunderstood even by people who are supposed
to be part of your own community such as lesbians and gays It happens so
often that there is actually a term for it 
bierasure This is simply something that happens when people deny that
bisexuality is a real thing or discriminate against bisexuals due to beliefs
like your parents seem to have 
The unfortunate truth is that you can never
be sure of how you parents may take this kind of information It sounds
promising that they are accepting of other sexual orientations and it may
simply be that your parents lack education about bisexuality With accurate
information they may come around but there is no way to be sure 
Some of my colleagues have already given you good information Here are some morethings that you can consider
and questions you can ask yourself before making the decision to tell them

1 If they dont respond the way you want them to have you developed a support
system to support you through it This is very important The truth is that all
the friends in the world wont prevent pain or sadness if your parents dont
respond as you hope but they will at least be there to remind you that you ARE
okay as you are And that is critical for you to remember 

2 There is great information on the internet about bisexuality that you can
offer your parents if you think it would be helpful It may be important for
them to know the kind of damage that is being done to bisexual adults and young
people because of the myths surrounding bisexuality Here is an article from
GLAAD about bierasure httpwwwglaadorgbisexualbierasure

3 Coming out to people is obviously deeply personal and should only take
place when you are ready Sometimes people get pressured from friends media
and even people they are romantically involved with to come out before they are
ready It really is up to you If you are feeling pressure from others dont
feel bad about setting your boundaries and telling them that you will come out
on your own time Intimate partners should respect you enough to understand
this 

4 Something else to think about is your own comfort in being bisexual Just
because someone is LGBTQ doesnt mean that they necessarily want to be Many
people struggle with this Having
your own doubts or insecurities may also play a part in how comfortable you are
in telling your parents So perhaps do some selfexploration about your
feelings toward yourself 

Sometimes people take friends with them
when they decide to come out to their parents This is something you may want
to consider The important thing to remember is that you are okay Really If
your parents dont respond well that doesnt mean that they never will Some
start off upset but then work their way through it 
Best of luck to you

Hello and thank you for your question You are clearly a
resourceful young person to reach out like this to find help Good for you I
have a few ideas and perhaps some other counselors will add some thoughts too

First good for you for taking care of yourself and making
really good decisions  such as not getting into the car with dad when he is
intoxicated It is really important that you consider your safety above all
else 
To answer your heading question yes it is quite common for
people to blame themselves for other peoples actions There are various
reasons why we do this For one thing someone may tell us that their behaviors are our fault And depending on things like our relationship to that
person past experiences and our selfesteem we may actually start to believe
it What is important to remember is that your parents have the responsibility
to be sure that you are safe and
cared for not the other way around 
As for the other things you mentioned I am concerned about both
your physical and emotional safety and wellbeing It sounds like your father
has an alcohol abuse problem and living with someone who is struggling with
addiction can be hard for anyone let alone a teenager who is also trying to
deal with things like school 
You may want to see if your school has a counselor or
someone you can talk to about what is going on I will tell you that in some
states what you have told me may be something that a counselor would have to
report to child protection services but not necessarily If you are concerned
about that ask the counselor what they are obligated to report 
If you dont know a counselor think about any other adult
that you would feel comfortable talking to They may have some ideas 
Sometimes individual states have nonprofit chat lines or
hotlines for teens to call if they are struggling with things You may be able
to find something like that in your state I do warn your about doing random
searches not every website is good so be careful 
This is clearly a tough spot for you to be in so one of the
things that I encourage you to do while searching for support is to focus on
taking care of yourself Sometimes things like this can really bring us down and
we stop doing the things we enjoy Try really hard not to let that happen If
you have interests do them If you catch yourself thinking too hard about
things try to find something fun to do to distract yourself Try to take care
of yourself in other ways such as eating well Exercise can really help when
we get stressed 
I hope some of this was helpful Good luck

Hello and thank you for reaching out to ask for help Surely this is a very confusing time for you If you have never had these
feelings and desires it could certainty shake everything you thought you knew
about yourself 
My guess is that you becoming sick around the time that this
started is likely a coincidence but I understand how you would make the
connection 
I have a feeling that a few things may be going on here It
is really hard to say since I dont know you how old you are etc But I will
share you with you some thoughts 
Some people when they have undesirable thoughts that really
surprise them have a really tough time getting rid of them Our reaction to
the thought can be very strong and our tendency to try to block it out stuff
it avoid it etc is not always successful In fact its usually not 
Its like telling you not to think of pink elephants I
would be willing to bet that you thought of a pink elephant just now 
So rather than fighting thoughts that you find confusing
sometimes it is helpful to allow yourself to explore the thought with curiosity
and without judgement Where is this thought coming from What are my feelings
about it Asking yourself these questions may help you come to a resolution
about what is going on 
One possibility is that you have developed an anxiety about
your thoughts and now you are in the process of obsessing about them but
another possibility is that you are legitimately exploring your sexuality and
gender I get the feeling from your question that you do not want to believe
that it is second possibility And that is okay 
You can try some of my suggestions but you can also see a
counselor who may be able to help you work through your confusion I would
suggest someone who has experience working with sexuality issues You can
usually find out what a counselor works with on their website What is
important is that you find someone who is nonjudgmental about what you are
experiencing 

I wish you well

I see a few issues hereFirst	 the age of the child is important If the child is considered an							
adult by state law with regard to counseling states differ on this								
 the range is typically between age 13 and age 18	 no one is allowed to							
be in the session without the childs consentSecond	 ethical and legal standards generally require that a							
counselor be in the role of a therapist	 or in the role of an evaluator	 but						
not both This means that a counselor								
should not generally provide both counseling and offer an opinion regarding who should								
have custody of a childThird	 knowing the details of any parenting plan or							
separation agreement is important								
Generally	 either parent can consent to counseling for a minor child and							
can be present during the childs sessions								
If a court order	 parenting plan	 or separation agreement specifies that						
one of the parents has sole decision making authority	 then only that parent can							
consent to counseling for the minor child and only that parent can be present during the childs								
sessionsIn a situation like this I would strongly recommend seeking								
out legal advice specific to your state law

571d184feba13fca346971c1Is it ethical for a social worker to ignore a clients phone callsI terminated my counseling relationship with a social worker several years ago I am now realizing that I would like to begin counseling again  The social workers voicemail message says that he returns calls in 24 hours"	 but he hasnt called me back I called him on the weekend and made it clear that I want him to call me back  Can he just ignore me	httpscounselchatcomquestionsisitethicalforasocialworkertoignoreaclientsphonecalls	Legal  RegulatoryProfessional Ethics	Eric Strm JD MA LMHC	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsericstrmjdmalmhc	Mental health providers should promptly return calls from current clients as well as from potential clients This is even true if the social worker or counselor is unable to make an appointment with the caller In that case the social worker should call you back to let you know that he is unable to schedule an appointment with youIn addition mental health providers have an obligation to follow through with their own communication standards For example if the social worker in this case has an outgoing voicemail message that promises returned calls within 24 hours he has an obligation to follow through on that promiseAll that being said it is also worth remembering that mental health professionals are just people too It is possible that he had an unforeseen emergency that kept him from from returning your call promptlyIn the end I agree with Sherrys advice If you feel this social worker is not a good fit for you you probably should trust your gut and find someone else who is a better fit	0

to tap into our own experience to help us connect with others in order to be
aware of how they are experiencing life

If you are feeling anxious maybe you are able to understand better others who
are going trough anxiety But I wonder
if instead of feeling empathy you may just want to find ways to reduce your
anxiety A good idea is to be very aware
of your anxiety triggers and once you identify them explore other ways you

your partner but maybe you are forgetting to consider what do you really want Having sexual relations is a very personal decision
you and your partner have to consent It

5797b028b43cd7825e26e248	Why do I feel like Im always wrong in everything in my relationship	My wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that Im doing things she finds disrespectful even when I dont mean it like that For example she gets offended when I call someone at work sweetheart  I wish I had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her  She doesnt and never will say she was wrong How do I get her to understand	httpscounselchatcomquestionswhydoifeellikeimalwayswrongineverythinginmyrelationship	RelationshipsMarriageWorkplace Relationships	Virginia Chow	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsvirginiachow	Hello That must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault This could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the longterm Based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wifes side of the story I would say that you are raising 3 different concernsOne is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified It may bear clarifying how each of you define infidelity Currently there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hookup chatroom texting extensive phone calls to a female friend viewing pornography a massage with happy ending physical intercourse or intimate emotional sharing Depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities If there is no truth to it then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying I feel you distancing from me In other words its not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her Often times accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness If so what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally If this is true you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again Otherwise if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needsThe second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a sweetheart The term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean youre so sweet and kind my dear or in a flirtatious manner to mean sweetie The intention behind the use is known only to the speaker You may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife If your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said If she finds the term disrespectful it may be her way of expressing I want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that I am not valued as much Therefore arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark Rather the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings You may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you Is saying sweetheart to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife That said if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding accomodating and prioritizing her needs then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities She may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fearsThe last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting shes wrong Indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong In the absence of her admitting to any faults it could seem like you are the one with the problem Unfortunately blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy This pattern can also trigger the partners insecurity as they witnesses the distancing which could make them angrier and more accusatory  creating a vicious cycle Finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment This kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding We sometimes take for granted the simple expression of Im sorry However it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that In my practice when a client tells me that his or her partner never says Im sorry I am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability If neither of them express it then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesnt do it These insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientatingFor more information about these services you are welcome to read my materials on my website at wwwPsychologyResourceca or

Lets just start with being real Expressing
yourself is vulnerable and being vulnerable is hard It takes courage and work
to be vulnerable My guess is that you have been shown in your lifetime that
being vulnerable ie expressing yourself is unsafe My assumption would be
you have been criticized or ignored when you have expressed yourself in the
past it has taught your emotional self to simply not do it again This is a normal
protective mechanism that you have used to cope with past feelings of hurt It
will take time and work to engage again in an emotional wayI would start my practicing and
identifying how you feel to yourself Check in with yourself multiple times a
day to gage where you are at emotionally After you feel you have a good grasp
on this start to engage in emotional conversations with others Choose others that
feel safe to you a good friend that knows you well or a sibling or family
member Expressing yourself is a behavior that you have suppressed out of
protection so you can choose to engage in safe emotional expression behaviors
just the same Best of luck

your own question by stating that you love cross dressing very much and I am
glad you enjoy it Cross dressing is something many people enjoy and there is
no harm in it whatsoeverMy question to you would be What is making you feel torn
about it There is unfortunately still a lot of negative stigma associated with
people who express their gender or sexuality in ways that differ from the
majority And sometimes certain sexual interests are actually very common or
even in the majority but because people carry shame about being different when
it comes to gender and sexuality we assume we are all aloneBeing a sexual or gender minority or someone who
participates in kink or expresses their sexuality or gender identity in a
unique and personal way often means suffering from something called
internalized oppression We grow up being exposed to certain
assumptions and beliefs about what is acceptable behavior and even
face consequences sometimes if we dont fit in the way others tell
us to Even if those assumptions are harmful and wrong we still internalize
them and feel guilty about who we are There is nothing wrong with us but
feeling stigmatized and isolated can lead to feelings of shame embarrassment
or like something is wrong with usBut there is absolutely nothing wrong with you so be proud
of who you are and what you enjoy You can continue to simply enjoy it
privately or maybe youd eventually like to share it with a partner or maybe
even join a community with similar interests Ill leave you with a quote from
comedian Eddie Izzard who identifies as in his own words a straight
transvestite Theyre not womens clothes Theyre my clothes I
bought them Take care and thanks for your question"	0

I recently found out he cheated on me with another women  He says he wants his family back but Im confused on what to do  Is it possible for us to get past the cheating or should I just move on"	httpscounselchatcomquestionsisitpossibleforacoupletoovercomecheatingifitonlyhappenedonce	IntimacyRelationshipsHuman Sexuality	Ashlie Brown	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsashliebrown	I think there are many different directions we could go as far as answering your question I think the first and most important question you need to ask yourself is do you truly believe in your heart that you can forgive him and trust him again Once you answer that question honestly then you can move in one of two directions First if you truly love this guy and see yourself being with him long term and for the long haul so to speakand you genuinely want to forgive him and trust him again that is completely doable and possible if you both put in the work But theres a greater issue here that needs to be addressed You say your relationship is good but theres been a sexual disconnect between the two of you and that usually indicates some type of emotional disconnect is at the core Would you agree with that or what are your thoughts Were you giving him less sexual attention than you normally do or were you guys never on the same page about sexual needs and having compatible sex drives If you are more of an emotional person than he is you may have been less interested sexually because he hasnt been meeting your emotional needs For instance if you hadnt been feeling loved cared about validated appreciated cherished and special to him than you may have felt less connected physically and been less interested This is a common issue with couples and can easily be addressed if the communication in your relationship is strong and you can find a way to express to him your frustrations In essence many women tend to have more emotional needs than men this is the way we are hardwired and there are exceptions to this of course but if you have been feeling neglected emotionally than your lack of interest in sex is actually completely understandable and NORMAL Until he understands this and can learn to tune into your needs emotionally you may struggle with feeling you are out of sync emotionally and sexually This leads to you both being frustrated but if all this is ringing true to you he seriously probably has no clue whats going on and may not know how youre feeling You need to communicate your needs to him if you are super lost with how to do that theres an awesome book called The Five Love Languages Its not that long and its very approachable and easy to apply the concepts to your relationships Invaluable resource for relationships and truly eye opening reallyThis is a long post Im sorry But this is such an important issue that is very common and many people feel lost about how to handle it So back to the second direction you can goyou feel very betrayed you arent sure if you can ever trust him again and you see yourself perhaps being paranoid forever and never being able to completely get over this For instance if he says he is working late or if he doesnt call or text right away when he usually does you may immediately jump to the worst case scenario that he is cheating again Of course it may not be true he may have legit reasons for his behaviors but the point is if you are going to be in paranoiamode OR you just will always be unsure whether he loves you and is committed to you and only you then the trust may not be able to be rebuilt You need to think long and hard about this and if you decide you have the capacity to forgive him and rebuild your foundation of trust and honesty then you need to let him know very explicitly what you need him to do to earn that trust back You cant just tell him vaguely I need to trust you again if he wants his family back and hes willing to do the work you need to line out exactly what he needs to do and he needs to do it But be prepared that he might throw out there that he cheated because he felt you werent attracted to him anymore or he tries to put the blame on you somehow because he says you werent meeting his physical needsif he throws that out there but you werent showing him the affection because you were frustrated emotionally then it all starts with you communicating that to him Get that bookIn conclusion if you feel in your heart there is no way you will be able to trust him again and you will always wonder if hes cheating when his behavior isnt spot on you will be a nervous wreck and perhaps cutting your losses now would spare you the continued heartache There is certainly a way to work through this but you both have to be motivated and you have to get to the source of why the cheating happened in the first place Rebuilding trust can be a long process maybe even years and for some people they may never be able to fully trust and let go of the past I truly recommend

Why this is happening and what can I do about it"	httpscounselchatcomquestionswhycantigetanerectionwithmygirlfriend	Human SexualityIntimacy	Todd Schmenk MS MEd	httpscounselchatcomtherapiststoddschmenkmsmed	"This is something I have
had to address with individuals often since working with couples is one of my
practices focuses The answer can depend upon several reasons all which
tend to be explored while in session If you or your counselor utilizes
an integral approach in which one of the main premises makes sure to check the
four irreducible perspectives subjective intersubjective objective and
interobjective  also known as the four quadrants in determining where the
challenges are it then becomes possible to identify what might be contributing
to or causing the challenge as well as offering up ways to address the
situationIn this case from the upperright
or behavioral and physical perspective we would want to make sure there is no
physical limitation or ailment meaning that you would need to visit your doctor
and have the basics checked such as blood pressure We would also look at particular behaviors to
see if you are doing something with is effecting performance such as
masturbating often or being influenced by pornographyNext we would look at the
upper left quadrant thoughts cognitions identity feelings to look at what
is going on here both during sexual activities and at other times If you are worried about your job your
family or under immense pressure to perform at work or while intimate this can
contribute to your situation From there
we would turn to the lower left quadrant cultural rules and tools to see who
you have learned to interpret challenges that come up during sex and look for
ways to shift update andor reshape the way you view sex and its
challenges It would be here that we
would see whether one is even comfortable using a service like counseling based
upon how your familyculture of origin views the professionFinally we would need to
account for challenges that show up in the lower right quadrant systems laws
rules of society such as your economic ability to try services and products as
well as whether such services and products were even available Once we have rolled through these areas it
then becomes possible to look at which aspects might need to be looked at
further in a more meaningful way to help you change a perspective or if just
getting a blood pressure medication is all you needTo sum your question then
of why you cant keep an erection we would need to look at your thoughts look
at your actual thoughts during the act as well as before and after look at
your behaviors look at your physical body for issues look at where you picked
up your rules and tools culture and look at your ability to access goods and
services They all contribute equally
and need to be taken into account So  as you can see there is no one possible answer to this but several I hope this helps"	0

I believe that counseling and finding a GOOD therapist
will be of significant help when the individual seeking therapy desires change
improvement and overall growth Most counseling involves homework and a level
of commitment outside of session that also contributes to resolution of
problems and an ability to cope with stresses in a productive way Here are
some of the key ways that therapy can help 
1 Helps to define the problem and gain a clearer
understanding of where it originates Many people seek counseling because of symptoms they are
experiencing These can include feeling sad increased sleeping substance use
panic attacks selfharm isolating ones self academic decline etc Often
times people are not aware of what is causing these symptoms Having a
therapist to help guide and explore why the symptoms are occurring and where
they come from will give individuals increased insight and awareness into their
problems 
2 Allows for a safe outlet to vent
Not everyone likes to share their problems with close
friends or family members Maybe they dont want others to know of their flaws
Maybe they dont want to burden others with their problems Or maybe they just
are not comfortable talking about themselves And in some situations people do
not have the option of talking with someone they know because they have no
friends or family While talking with those we know can help bring some relief
it is also nice to talk with someone like a therapist who is objective and
emotionally removed from given situations Counseling gives a safe outlet in
which one can express their personal feelings and thoughts without feeling
judged
3 Counselors can offer various problem solving solutions

A good therapist usually will not directly point their
client in the direction they need to go Counseling is about growth and
teaching the client to identify triggers and use effective coping strategies

4 Gives one the tools needed to cope with current and future
problems
Many individuals that seek therapy have never learned
good coping strategies Perhaps they did not have parents or caretakers to
model productive ways to cope or maybe the symptoms they are suffering from are
overbearing and take away the energy needed to cope Different diagnoses
require different tools however some are beneficial for any problem and any
individual These include but are not limited to relaxation techniques
breathing exercises development of healthy routines using mindfulness
improving communication skills and recognizing and changing maladaptive
thought patterns A good counselor will teach clients how to use these tools
will often practice them during session and will assign homework for further
practice and mastery of the skills

Ive fought depression and won however stress and anxiety are killing me I feel that my friends dont listen to me I know they have their own problems which I do my best to help with But they dont always try to help me with mine when I really need them I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust"	httpscounselchatcomquestionshowcanigetpeopletolisten	AnxietyFamily ConflictDepressionStressSocial Relationships	Margaret Van Ackeren	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsmargaretvanackerenyorbalinda	One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others especially parents do not listen While your parents surely love you and want to understand you it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heardTalk to them during a nonemotional moment when the discussion is not already heated In other words do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk Let them know you have something important to get off your chest Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as you NEVER listen you ALWAYS say and stray away from placing blame Instead of beginning your statements with you try using I by letting them know how their behavior effects you Finally let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understandI would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist teacher or school counselor if possibleMost schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for helpBest of luck to you	0

there lived a village of creatures along the bottom of a great crystal
river The current of the river swept silently over them all  young and
old rich and poor good and evil  the current going its own way knowing
only its own crystal self
Each creature in its own
manner clung tightly to the twigs and rocks of the river bottom for clinging
was their way of life and resisting the current was what each had learned
from birth
But one creature said
at last I am tired of clinging Though I cannot see it with my eyes
I trust that the current knows where it is going I shall let go and let
it take me where it will Clinging I shall die of boredom
The other creatures laughed
and said Fool Let go and that current you worship will throw you tumbled
and smashed against the rocks and you will die quicker than boredom
But the one heeded them
not and taking a breath did let go and at once was tumbled and smashed
by the current across the rocks
Yet in time as the creature
refused to cling again the current lifted him free from the bottom and
he was bruised and hurt no more
And the creatures downstream
to whom he was a stranger cried See a miracle A creature like ourselves
yet he flies See the messiah come to save us all
And the one carried in
the current said I am no more messiah than you The river delights to
lift us free if only we dare let go Our true work is this voyage this
adventure
But they cried the more
Savior all the while clinging to the rocks and when they looked again
he was gone and they were left alone making legends of a savior

How do I get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time"	httpscounselchatcomquestionshowdoigetmyhusbandtolistentome	RelationshipsMarriage	Toni Genovese	httpscounselchatcomtherapiststonigenovese	Thanks for reaching out This is a great question Communication is definitely a 2way street One person cannot participate in a discussion It takes a talker and a listener Furthermore communication will breakdown if each party is only focusing on his or her agenda and is not open to what the other person is saying since I cant ask you questions about what is going on I am going to make a guess at one situation that comes up a lot when I work with couples One person focuses more on solving the issue than listening to their partner This can be frustrating for the partner who wants to just be heardI understand that you are working really hard to listen to him and he might not be putting as much effort into listening to you That can be really frustrating and difficult and I want to acknowledge you for wanting to improve your relationshipOne of the best strategies to gettting heard is actually to BE A GOOD LISTENER to someone else I know you are probably already a good listener and for you to work on listening skills may seem counterintuitive right You want to get heard and now you are the one doing the listening But this can really create more effective communication if you invest time working on doing some active listening in your relationship because then you get to model those skills for your husband and allow him to see what it feels like to be listened to and then you can even teach him some of those skills In other words you practice specific techniques that you can use and then teach later onHere are some skills for you to use consciously and then you can teachPay attention and use your body language to convey that you are in the conversation No texting or distractions Lean in FocusListen for content and for emotion Clarify what you dont understand Try to understand the persons underlying emotionsDont rush to judgement or to changing what is going on with the person Sit in a place where you are really curious and want to understand what is going onEncourage the other person to continue speaking Nod and vocalize that you hear what they are sayingAsk questions to get to understand the other persons point of viewI believe when we can model these kinds of listening skills and the other person feels heard they will be more likely to listen to us If you dont find that this doesnt spill over in that way then have a discussion about what you are practicing and that you are learning these skills to be a better listener so you can understand him better Then explain how it might be helpful if you both tried it If there is push back from him set up a trial period to just try the skill perhaps for 2 weeks and see if it helps If communication is really breaking down then it might be time to work with a counselor who can help with these skillsBest of luck to you	0

Is this something I should be concerned abou Any advice will help"	httpscounselchatcomquestionsimconcernedaboutmy12yearolddaughter	ParentingChildren  Adolescents	Sherry Katz LCSW	httpscounselchatcomtherapistssherrykatzlcsw	Have you asked your daughter why shes doing the behaviors you describeOften the best way to find out why someone does something is to simply ask them their reasonHer answer will give you some guidance as to next possible stepsIf shes pretending to be a fantasy figure or trying to find out how being taller feels or walking on high heels or some other image then knowing this rules out that she has some unbearable pain in her arch which may require more practical answers such as new shoes or even indicate a medical problemAsk if shes noticed any change in the way she walks Maybe she doesnt know shes doing this and maybe she feels embarrassed to tell you shes doing something a bit oddSince usually 12 year olds dont color is it new that she started coloringMaybe given the fact of messy handwriting shes in a phase of pretending or reflecting on good times as a young childThen this becomes the topic of examinationDoes she feel insecure about being on the cusp of adolescenceSome of these questions can be asked directly and some are for you to first decide based on what you know of your daughter which questions and what direction to take in understanding your daughters motivation 	0

Chances are most of the goodbyes you have experienced in your life have been
difficult Saying goodbye to a therapist can be different It can be an
opportunity to create a healthy ending in a positive relationship in your life
If you work with a therapist who is skilled then saying goodbye can be just as
transformative as the therapy itself Ending therapy is also known
as termination I know termination doesnt have a great ring to it
However it is what it is It is an ending of the relationship as it existed
It is reality cold and stark Of course when I talk to clients I dont use the
word termination I usually say our goodbye Under what circumstances does therapy usually
end Therapy should end when a client does not need further assistance is not
receiving any benefit from therapy or might be harmed by continuing to work
with a particular therapistIn the best case scenario
the decision to move on from therapy and say our goodbyes happens when both
the therapist and the client feel like the client is ready to move on and move
up Ending the therapeutic relationship
should actually be worked on from the very first session What I mean by that
is there should be an understanding that the work we do together will have an
ending and that is a good thing because it means the client has gained the
skills to continue working on themselves independently So the first session I
have with clients usually outlines a plan where the end goal is discussed and
we both have an understanding of the skills the client wants to learn or what
they hope to achieve Now sometimes there are
situations where the therapist ends the relationship and the client may take
that personally it is hard when any relationship ends and it might bring up
feelings of sadness and fear or abandonment Any good therapist will end the
relationship based on what is right for the client What are some situations
where a therapist might end the relationshipIf the situation the client
is dealing with is out of the therapists scope of practice the therapist may
end the relationship and refer the client to someone else This is in the
clients best interest Another reason a therapist might end the relationship
is that the therapist is in a place in her life which prevents her from being
objective and helpful A therapist who
is going through a painful divorce may have difficulty working with a couple
that considering divorce A good therapist may see that their judgement may be
clouded and want to refer the client to see someone else This is good practice
and helps the clientIf a client is actively
suicidal or actively using substances then the therapist may end the
relationship and refer out for a higher level of care The client may need to
be hospitalized or may need an inpatient substance abuse treatment program
Therapy may be terminated while they are being treated and may continue after
the intensive program is completed
Ending therapy should be a
time for connection and bringing together accomplishments or reviewing the
next important step the client needs to take It should not be an experience of
abandonment A skilled therapist will help a client gain a new perspective on
closure For some clients it may be the one time in their lives when they get
a clean ending in a healthy relationship and they get to feel a sense of
control on creating that endingGood luck to you"	0

How can I deal with being bullied at school when the teachers wont help"	httpscounselchatcomquestionshowdoidealwithbullyingatschool	Children  Adolescents	Sherry Katz LCSW	httpscounselchatcomtherapistssherrykatzlcsw	To be bullied is very painfulIm glad you know the bullies are doing the wrong thing and whatever they are telling you is pure meannessDepending on how independent you feel why not tell either your classroom teacher or schedule an appointment with the vice principalBullying other students is taken very seriously in some states and schools are expected to address the bullying until the victimized student feels safeIf you hesitate to do this on your own then would you ask either of your parents or even a friend of yours who is also in the school to report the problemIn case you are afraid the bullies will retaliate for reporting them then tell this to whatever school authority you decide to ask for helpYoure entitled to be protected by your school	0

I have anxiety and I had a rough childhood but now Ill start to hit my head and sometimes not realize it but I dont know how to stop or even why Im doing it 

How can I help myself to change my behavior"	httpscounselchatcomquestionshowcanihelpmyselfandchangemybehavior	Behavioral ChangeAnxiety	Shawn Thomas Berthel MS LMHC	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsshawnthomasberthelmslmhc	Hello I have to wonder from a behavioral perspective if what you are doing is useful for you In other words does it serve a purpose in some way when you find yourself doing it Yes this could well be an expression of anxiety or maybe some type of coping skill you have developed over the years to deal with stressful situations Yet it sounds like you have developed a sort of kneejerk behavioral conditioning that causes you to do this behavior during specific or perhaps even nonspecific circumstances Do you think it is a selfsoothing behavior Do you feel good after you have done it The behavior itself is likely causing some form of slow physical damage so I would recommend you have yourself checked by a doctor to rule out any injury If none exists this obviously doesnt excuse the behavior it just says that for the moment luck is on your sideWhen we do any behavior of any kind it is good to ask if what we are doing has merit or value Is the behavior helping us to solve our problem or is it merely creating yet another problem by doing the behavior in the first place In the same way that a person might drink excessively because they are stressed and need to cope with some unresolved issue when they are done drinking the original problem will still likely be there but now they are intoxicated No closer to solving the issue When we deal with things like anxiety or depression we need to do things that work on dealing with the symptoms but also get to the root issue that created those feelings and find effective solutions So the things we do to cope with life events need to not be ones that cause us harm but rather support us as we move forward and work to deal with what life throws at usSometimes seeking support from a friend or a counselor is a good idea Being given the opportunity to express your feelings about what is going on around you and getting feedback and insight from others is much more effective than actions of selfharm wouldnt you agree So I would encourage you to find a counselor or a trusted friend who can help you find positive behaviors you can take to deal with your feelings as you also work to find the answers to the day to day issues of living a life filled with promise and opportunityReach out if you need helpthere will likely be a hand there waiting for you	0

My mother forced my father out of my life so I do not know who he really is Weve gotten in contact but he just makes comments on how much I look like her when in fact I look more like him  This makes me mad because I dont want to look like my mother I hate her All that she did was bring me down and make me homeless which she was successful at  I need guidance in my life  I dont want to lose my wife but we need to have a space because we usually hit each other and its not healthy Im dying to make our relationship healthy Ive never wanted anything more than this Please help me I need your advice"	httpscounselchatcomquestionshowdoisavemymarriage	Domestic ViolenceAnger ManagementSelfesteemMarriageFamily Conflict	Shawn Thomas Berthel MS LMHC	httpscounselchatcomtherapistsshawnthomasberthelmslmhc	Hello It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now Marriages take lots of work and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young  good bad or indifferent There are no easy answers to your questions and I wont presume that my response to you will be the linchpin that heals all your pain But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections First and foremost cut yourself some slack No one is perfect We fail more often than we succeed but in the end we learn and that learning helps us grow Yes youre right the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good and need to stop You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor Seeing a therapist for yourself and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach You have issues that you need to resolve that while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life they are separate from your marriage in many respectsJoining a marriage support group can also be helpful You can find these through local counseling resources Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful If you belong to a religious or spiritual community then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for youLastly parents are imperfect Yepits true They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage We limp along and do our best Having said that we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life Both with ourselves and toward other people So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit I am sure that remains to be seen but either way you both must be involved in saving it If only one of you cares then 100 of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person Thats not fair So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants and work to create an amicable solution All of this said seek out supportive friends and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life One way or the other you will benefit from itBe well	0

Now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesnt act her age I dont know why this is happening Is this normal"	httpscounselchatcomquestionsmydaughterisntactingherage	ParentingChildren  Adolescents	Elissa Gross	httpscounselchatcomtherapistselissagross	HelloIt sounds like you are really concerned about your daughter because you have noticed a significant change in her behavior   Its really a great first step that you are reaching out to get some ideas about what might be going on  You are clearly an observant and hands on mom who wants to be sure that her daughter is okThis is a tough question to answer without more information  With that said  I have found that under stress people regress In other words  many people  children and adults alike  often regress and behave differently  as if they were younger than their actual age  when under stress   Therefore  my first question would be  has anything been happening recently that is causing your daughter stress  This could be anything from conflict at home  recent changes such as moving  divorce  a loss of some kind  switching schools  or losing a friend or friends   Additionally  sometimes if children are feeling bullied or left out by same age peers  they may gravitate toward younger playmates as a way to boost their social confidence   I would suggest that you think about what stressors  changes may have occurred recently You may also want to check in with her teacher s to see if they have noticed any changes in your daughters behavior at school I also think that you can have a conversation with your daughter in order to see if you can get a sense about whether or not something has been bothering her Something as simple as  I have noticed that you arent spending time with the friends you used to hang out with  it seems like you have been playing with a lot of younger kids lately  Am I right about that   and then if she says yes you might ask a few questions such as  did something happen with your friends that is making you not want to be with them Has something been bothering you lately  Are you feeling upset or worried  If she denies that there is anything wrong you might even say  I know that sometimes when I feel stressed or worried  I tend to act a little differently  sometimes I withdraw from my regular group of friends  or I get cranky and feel less like myself  I wonder if something like that is happening with you If you are really concerned and not getting any answers from her and  or her teachers  perhaps you can consult with a therapist to discuss your concerns further and decide if it might help for your daughter to talk to a therapist a few times  or at the very least you can get more specific tips from a therapist about how to approach this issue with your daughter more effectively  The more detail you can provide about what you have noticed with your daughter  including any changes or new stressors  any possible patterns to this behavior  if school has become more difficult socially and or academically  the more a therapist can guide you about how best to handle your concerns and talk with your daughter in a way that is helpful to herGood luck  I believe that this may just be a phase and it seems to me to be well within the normal range of childrens behavior I do though think that you will feel more assured about this if you can get to the bottom of whats going on  	0

57799c9772f4321a37b64221	Is it normal to cry during therapy	I start counselingtherapy in a few days Im freaking out but my main fear is that Ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about	httpscounselchatcomquestionsisitnormaltocryduringtherapy	AnxietyCounseling Fundamentals 	Elissa Gross	httpscounselchatcomtherapistselissagross	Hi there  As someone who has practiced as a clinical psychologist for 25 years  I would say that crying is NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT AT ALL  Almost every single person I have worked with has cried at one point or another Starting therapy takes a lot of courage when you work with a therapist once you feel safe  you talk about a lot of very private and potentially emotional things that you may have never discussed with anyone before I have seen people cry with sadness  cry with relief at releasing painful things they have held onto for a long time cry because they feel so relieved that they finally feel heard  I myself have sometimes cried with clients because some things they talk about are so profoundly moving I can assure you that most  if not all  therapists expect clients to cry and there is nothing to be embarrassed about  Crying can be very cathartic and can allow us to release a lot of painful feelings we have been stuffing down  Crying is often a sign that you are really working things through and getting in touch with feelings that you need to get in touch with in order to heal So  to summarize  dont worry at all about crying It will probably feel uncomfortable at first  but I promise you  you will not be judged for crying in therapy  And it will be less embarrassing once it happens a time or two and you are assured that your therapist will be there for you and wont judge you Good luck 	0
