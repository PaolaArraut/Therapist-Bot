# Therapist-Bot 
## Project Objective:
    Create a therapy, CBT-based A.I. model that is able to respond to a user talking about the problems they are facing and be able to make a diagnosis. The A.I. could then give proper recommendations on how the user could morph their negative habits to positive ones to help them in their day-to-day.
